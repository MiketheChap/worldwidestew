    <h1>Resilient Remembrance</h1>
    
      <p class="author">By Mike Davis</p>
    
    <time>September 11, 2024</time>
    <p>Stuck on the tarmac and then the terminal at O&rsquo;hare on September 11, 2001, my son and I tried to figure out what to do, where to go, and how we would respond. We knew precisely nothing about what was going on. Memory is a fuzzy thing. As I remember, somewhere along the way, someone decided the best idea was to turn off the televisions in the terminal. Likely to reduce panic.</p>
<p><em>Pro-Tip for the <strong>geniuses who want to reduce panic</strong>:</em> - don&rsquo;t turn off the one source of news if the <em>cat is already out of the bag</em>.</p>
<p>Our ordeal began on the tarmac where my ten-year-old son and I were waiting to take off. About forty-five minutes in, the Captain came on and said, <em>Ladies and Gentlemen, we regret to tell you that there has been some kind of terrorist attack along the East Coast. We don&rsquo;t have any details. But, for safety&rsquo;s sake, we must return to the terminal.</em></p>
<p>We got back to the terminal and then tried to figure out where we would go, where we&rsquo;d stay, and how to be safe. Even crazy things entered the mind: <em>The terminal has a lot of glass walls. We&rsquo;ve got to quickly get into a more secure area, prefereably downstairs.</em></p>
<p>I worry about our country today. On that day, the <em>better angels of our nature</em> was on full display. I remember a woman who saw my son and I huddling alone near the escalators. She didn&rsquo;t wait a beat. She asked if we had a place to stay. If we needed one, we could come with her.</p>
<p>Fortunately, my wife had friends I&rsquo;d never met, Nancy and John, who we were sure would be a place to stay. Indeed, they were. So, we didn&rsquo;t need to use this kind lady&rsquo;s home. Still, I&rsquo;ll be forrever grateful and indebted to her solace, if not her home. I wish I could thank her now.</p>
<p>On that day, I found some strength even in the midst of confusion, fear, and doubt. I&rsquo;ve written this poem as a reflection on <em>my experience</em> that day. I&rsquo;ve also written it to remind myself that - if I could trust myself then - I can be assured of the wisdom I need for today. You have also had similar experiences. The one&rsquo;s where you survived because you listened to your internal compass. This is a psalm to celebrate our internal compass.</p>
<h4 id="remembrance">Remembrance</h4>
<p>by Mike Davis</p>
<p>There was that moment<br>
The instant when you were called<br>
To find an unknown strength,<br>
To exercise a wisdom for which you felt unprepared,<br>
And maybe unjustified to exercise<br>
A moment for which there was no personal plan<br>
No guideline<br>
No idea.<br>
It just was.</p>
<p>You were called to make choices<br>
on the fly.<br>
To protect self,<br>
loved ones, or both<br>
Unsure the extent, location, or proximity<br>
of what you feared.</p>
<p>All you had<br>
Was your best instinct.<br>
Your most intuitive thoughts.<br>
Not running, exactly,<br>
But moving with caution,<br>
thought,<br>
spirit,<br>
and deliberation.</p>
<p>Looking for those<br>
with whom you could safely huddle<br>
And avoiding those<br>
From whom you must hide.</p>
<p>You survived because you listened.<br>
Because you listened to your inner caution<br>
But not too much. You had to go on.<br>
You survived because you knew to stop<br>
And take stock,<br>
But not too long.</p>
<p>You survived because you considered what might come,<br>
and from where,<br>
but also because you avoided attachment<br>
to any one place.</p>
<p>Today, distant from that place and time.<br>
Even now, those resources aren&rsquo;t far away.<br>
You can - and would - do it all again<br>
If you needed to.<br>
Those resources sprung up from within you<br>
From your experiences,<br>
From your wisdom,<br>
From your trust (and distrust),<br>
From uncertainty (and internal assurance).<br>
For some moment today,<br>
Sit back and try to trust the Inner You<br>
The You with doubts and fears,<br>
Hopes and dreams.<br>
The You who&rsquo;s responsive,<br>
Whose strong inner River,<br>
Will crest and ebb,<br>
When you listen and need it most.</p>
<p>Mike Davis</p>
