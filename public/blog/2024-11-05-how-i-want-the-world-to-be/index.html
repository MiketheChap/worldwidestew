    <h3 id="the-world-i-would-like-to-see">The world I would like to see.</h3>
<p>When voting the most important question we can ask is this: what kind of future world is livable for all people.</p>
<p>I’ve avoided placing my political beliefs on these pages. While I won’t name any names here, I will be clear about the reasons we should choose candidates and to say that I consider it a moral obligation of the highest order for all people to vote. If you say you believe in “life” for any reason, then you have no moral excuse not to vote.</p>
<p>Instead of saying <em>who</em> you should vote for, here are some guidelines to use as you consider how to vote. Sadly, no candidates check off all boxes. Instead, they all fall on a spectrum.</p>
<ol>
<li>We don’t use fear to conjure or manipulated emotions or anxiety.</li>
<li>We base reality on science, not magical thinking. If your candidate doesn’t historically support the best versions of laboratory science, you should reconsider who you plan to vote for.</li>
<li>Where we may <em>forgive and forget</em> incidents, but we never ignore patterns of disrespect, disregard, abuse, and petulance.</li>
<li>Quality health care is a right for all people, not a select few. A civilization that ignores the health needs of any of it’s members has already lost it’s way.</li>
<li>Everyone contributes to society to the extent they can. The most wealthy have benefitted from their culture, education, and background. They often imagine themselves as uniquely gifted or productive. The reality is that there is no credible evidence that <em>trickle down economics</em> works.Thus, they need to contribute to support that society more than those who are less fortunate given the harder circumstances of their lives.</li>
<li>Responsibility and liberty are inextricably associated with one another. People do not have rights without the expectation they will live in a way that promotes societal wellness. This is the nature of the <em>social contract.</em></li>
<li>Society is created by a joint responsibility of all people to  one another. Hatred is not acceptable. Internal warfare is not acceptable. Multiple points of view are okay and promoted. There is no effort to eradicte other views or positions other than those that harm peoples or cultures.</li>
<li>Where kindness and respect is the expectation.</li>
<li>Might does not make right. Zero-sum games are neither only nor the best games.</li>
<li>No one is above the law. No one. Neither legally nor as part of any <em>gentleman’s agreement</em>. Parts of our society want to <em>make an example</em> of lawbreakers (usually those who can’t afford legal representation).</li>
<li>Respect of all views is the key component of democracy. We are living in a time where some people feel entitled to impose their views on others. Sometimes, people feel their <em>religious beliefs</em> - because they supposedly come from God - allow them to engage in any form of civil destruction up to some idea of <em>Holy War.</em> These individuals are a far cry from anything God would want.</li>
</ol>
