    <h1>Checking in</h1>

    <blockquote>
<p><em>Describe your pain</em>, the doctor said.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Burning, Shooting. Stabbing. And, burning again. Oh, and stabbing again.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Part of becoming more mindful is <em>awareness of physical sensations</em>.  This might be fullness/hunger, wanting, liking, not liking, tension, anxiety (that feeling in the <em>pit of the stomach that something not good is coming</em>), or pain. Other examples are tightness in the facial muscles, neck, back, shoulders or head. There are also emotional sensations we should <em>check in for</em>. Thongs like the anxety we mentioned  earlier. Other examples are fatigue, depression, guilt, sadness, and anger.</p>
<p>But, as much as we might think <em>checking in</em> has to do with negative sensations, it’s a mistake to limit it to the negative. It also has to do with positive sensations: looseness, freedom, attention, flow, awe, kindness, and gratitude. Each one of these has identified and specific variants. As an example of a positive sensation, after completing a stressful situation, we might feel <em>like a enormous weight was taken off.</em> In our modern society, we would blow right past that sensation. That would be a big mistake! We should learn to <em>savor it</em>!</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, after I woke up, I didn’t need to <em>officially</em> check in with my body (as important as that is to do): my body made it’s voice known the moment I got out of bed. I hurt. Sorenoess from arthritis and burning/stabbing from sciatica. A BIG OUCH! It’s North Texas so my allergies were alive, too.</p>
<p>But, Cassie, my dog, wanted nothing less than a thorough walk. So we walked.</p>
<p>About three-quarters of the way through, I <em>checked in</em> with my body again. My pain was substantially less. I’m not asking for gone. I’m hoping for <em>less</em>. And, I was listening to a podcast and <em>learned something new</em>. I arrived home in a substantially happier mood than when I left!</p>
<p>Two observations stood out for me:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Checking in</em> is good. <em>Checking in</em> regularly is better. Making a habit of checking in is esssential.</li>
<li>I’m not sure who said it, but as a general principle, <em>motion is lotion</em>. Get up often from our chairs and walk.</li>
</ol>
<p>One final note: any management book worth buying is going to stress the importance of <em>rounding on your employees</em>. If your management book doesn’t mention rounding, throw it back. If you want your employees to care about your wishes, you better care about their’s.</p>
<p>Not coincidentally, another synonym for <em>rounding</em> is <em>checking in</em>. The same principle applies to our body as it does to our employees: blindness to either one is a recipe for a slow erosion of health and strength.</p>
