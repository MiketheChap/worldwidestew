    <h1>Where&#39;s my treat?</h1>
    
      <p class="author">By mike davis</p>
    
    <time>August 24, 2024</time>
    <p>A couple of days ago, I removed the broken dishwasher in a hurry. My sciatica was already enraged. Then, dealing with the dishwasher further triggered my body&rsquo;s anger. Finally, I decided I would help myself by doing some yoga: you know, <em>to help it</em>. <em>Motion is lotion</em>, I told myself.</p>
<p>So, last night, I paid the price.</p>
<p>The pain madde it seem I&rsquo;d <em>never get to sleep</em>.</p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s not going to get better.</em></p>
<p>This morning, my dog was looking for her treat holder. She couldn&rsquo;t find it anywhere. No wonder! She expects it to be on the floor. That&rsquo;s where she always finds it.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t out of sight. It was <em>out of mind</em>. It was above floor level, out of it&rsquo;s usual expected location, and slightly out of sight.</p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m not going to find it.</em></p>
<p>A game I played years ago, <em>Myst</em> was filled with brilliant puzzles. While a lot of people bought it because it was famed for it&rsquo;s beauty and puzzles, unless you had a <em>patient mind</em>, you&rsquo;d get frustrated. The puzzles were just too hard for most people. So, despite it being an artistic <em>tour de force</em>, it didn&rsquo;t sell nearly as many copies as it might have. You just gave up, beauty or not.</p>
<p><em>I can&rsquo;t figure it out.</em></p>
<p>Sometimes, it&rsquo;s hard to see a way forward. This is epidemic for teens right now. They are giving up at high rates.</p>
<p><em>I can have what I want right now</em>, is the new life axiom. There&rsquo;s very little sense that things will come tomorrow or next week. We don&rsquo;t need to be patient. We don&rsquo;t trust the future. We don&rsquo;t have to <em>look for it (out of it&rsquo;s usual place) or wait for it (longer than we want)</em>.</p>
<p>(<strong>Spoiler Alert</strong>) - It&rsquo;s not a big spoiler but if you haven&rsquo;t seen the Academy-award winning movie <em>Shadowlands, go watch it and then come back</em>. Otherwise, proceed.</p>
<p><em>Shadowlands</em>, tells the too-short story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis">C.S. Lewis</a> love for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_Davidman">Joy Davidman</a>. Lewis, near the end of his life, finds what he longed for all along. Was it worth it? At the end of the movie, Lewis - through tears - tells Davidman&rsquo;s son,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Why love if losing hurts so much?<br>
I have no answers any more.<br>
Only the life I&rsquo;ve lived.<br>
Twice in that life I&rsquo;ve been given the choice<br>
As a boy and as a man.<br>
The boy chose safety.<br>
The man chooses suffering.<br>
The pain now, is part of the suffering then.<br>
That&rsquo;s the deal&hellip;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is wisdom in patience, in holding on, in perseverance. What we want won&rsquo;t always be in the same place, where we want it, nor when we want it. Keep looking. Keep searching.</p>
