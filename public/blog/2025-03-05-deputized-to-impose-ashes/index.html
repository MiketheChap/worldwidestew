    <h1>Deputized on Ash Wednesday</h1>
    
    <time>March 5, 2025</time>
    <p>It&rsquo;s Ash Wednesday. I feel a little sad about that. Why? When I think of Ash Wednesday, here&rsquo;s the thing I remember most.</p>
<p>I was a chaplain at Baylor Scott &amp; White Heart and Vascular Hospital in Dallas. Even though I wasn&rsquo;t Catholic, each Ash Wednesday I was deputized to impose Ashes on the foreheads of anyone who wanted them. I received Ashes and then was <em>deputized</em> to impose them on others. I would visit every unit at the hospital to make sure people could get Ashes if they wanted them. There were always lots of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Why does your head have a black mark on it?</strong><br>
<em>To be deputized to impose Ashes, you have to receive Ashes and be repentant.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What is the significance of imposing Ashes?</strong><br>
<em>I&rsquo;m not Catholic, but it has to do with realizing we are sinful and we need God. At least, that&rsquo;s my interpretation.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do you have to be Catholic?</strong><br>
<em>No. See my forehead. I had it done and I&rsquo;m not Catholic.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do I have to become Catholic?</strong><br>
<em>No. See the above answer. In fact, you stay just the way you are.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do you have to be religious?</strong><br>
<em>I&rsquo;m not speaking for the Catholic (or any other church), but I could imagine everyone feels like a mess sometime in their lives. Right then is a perfect moment for your own Ash Wednesday. Even if you don&rsquo;t have Ashes. If you want to call on the Universe and say, I need help, then do that then. Don&rsquo;t be bound by any ideology or belief system where it doesn&rsquo;t fit you.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>People from all different traditions wanted me to give them Ashes. <em>Go ahead, hit me!</em></p>
<p>Before coming to work at the hospital, Ash Wednesday wasn&rsquo;t part of my faith tradition. But, in a surprising turn, it became every year&rsquo;s most Sacred event. I got to touch the heads of countless patients, family members, and staff, offer the words, <em>&ldquo;Repent and believe the Gospel,&rdquo;</em> and then impose Ashes. This little encounter symbolized all that gives me hope about the human and divine.</p>
<p><em>I miss those days.</em> This is the second year where I haven&rsquo;t touched those foreheads. For all of you I did touch, who were on  my list each year, I still send you my love. The Ashes went one way. The Touch, though, went both.</p>
<hr>
<p>For all my friends, patients, and family members. For my wife and dogs who put up with long, long days.</p>
