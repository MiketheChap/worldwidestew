    <p>Here are my blog posts. I previously posted them on Obsidian but I&rsquo;m moving them (slowly) to this website. It will take time. I&rsquo;m also going to be publishing new pages as often as they come to mind.</p>

                It was a beautiful winter night to take our dog out for a walk. Looking toward the west I saw the planetary alignment my wife had told me about earlier that day. I immediately pulled out my phone to capture a picture. But, the picture didn&rsquo;t look just right. So, I opened a browser window to see what settings to adjust for night shots. I must have messed with my phone settings for ten minutes before the ridiculousness of the situation dawned on me.

                What would your belief system - your religion and politics, for example - have to do to cause you to reject it? It&rsquo;s a question for our ideology-driven times.
Decades ago I believed in almost every facet of the Christian Nationalist dream, including their beliefs about sexuality. I ignored the human experience, following ideology instead. Then, as a chaplain in training, I sat by a gay man who lost his partner moments before.

            <time><b>Published</b>: May 10, 2025</time>
            
            
                Many years ago, I worked in a little religious school. One of the children could barely speak. She had many siblings. She came to school with bruises. One day she accidentally fell out of the car. I told the principal that we should report the situation. I was told that it wasn&rsquo;t our business and that reporting them to government authorities wasn&rsquo;t right. I still anonymously reported them. My employment ended soon thereafter.

            <time><b>Published</b>: April 28, 2025</time>
            
            
                Satisfaction guaranteed or your money back.
When someone says, Satisfaction guaranteed or your money back they are upping the value of their promise. They are saying, You have nothing to lose.
But, even if you are able to get your money back, you&rsquo;ve still lost something: time and trust. Broken trust steadily erodes our lives and connections. The return of our money can&rsquo;t return the time and hope for a resolution to our problem.
