    <h1>The Hard Work</h1>
    
      <p class="author">By Mike Davis</p>
    
    <time>July 19, 2024</time>
    <p>We recently purchased a robot vacuum cleaner. It&rsquo;s amazing. I understand there&rsquo;s a lot of math involved in it&rsquo;s mapping and processing. Cassie, the doggoe, gives it a wide berth. We&rsquo;ve also had to make our own adaptations (keep cords off the floors). As much as Cassie sheds, this felt like a helpful purchase.</p>
<p>I do have my doubts about all these technologies, though. They may reduce our labors in some ways, but they increase it in others. As well, they add other expenses.</p>
<p>Finally, I worry they take us away from the essentially human work and pleasures. This morning I read about this <a href="https://www.hackster.io/news/give-piece-a-chance-e3b09f45b128">Jigsaw puzzle solver</a>. It can reduce the time it takes a human to solve a jigsaw puzzle by as much as 200%.</p>
<p>Barb loves her jigsaw puzzles. We have at least one completed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter">Harry Potter puzzle</a> hanging on a wall here in the house (somewhere&hellip;). She loves her Harry Potter and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego">Lego</a> puzzles. The more pieces, the better!</p>
<p>I like watching her progress and process. She paces herself. She is careful to avoid letting the pieces fall. When she hits a hard place, she stops and returns later. And, when it&rsquo;s done, she&rsquo;s exuberant.</p>
<p>In my studies on depression, the process of healing from depression involves daily and long-term activities providing pleasure and accomplishment. In fact, this approach to depression reduction is called <em>behavior activation</em>. It involves action, not frittering our time away in thought. Do things that give pleasure and accomplishment.</p>
<p>Returning to <em>Hard Work</em>, technology promises to make our life easier. Is that always a good goal?</p>
<p>A better question is this: does this technology really support my <em>well-being?</em></p>
<p>We need to work with our hands, wash dishes, plant things, do math, and to show our work. We need to complete the puzzle without a computer. The human spirit craves <em>The Hard Work</em> of doing things.</p>
