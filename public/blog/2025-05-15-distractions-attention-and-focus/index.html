    <h1>Distractions, attention, and focus</h1>
    
    <time>May 15, 2025</time>
    <p>It was a beautiful winter night to take our dog out for a walk. Looking toward the west I saw the planetary alignment my wife had told me about earlier that day. I immediately pulled out my phone to capture a picture. But, the picture didn&rsquo;t look just right. So, I opened a browser window to see what settings to adjust for night shots. I must have messed with my phone settings for ten minutes before the ridiculousness of the situation dawned on me.</p>
<p>Why not just look at and enjoy what you&rsquo;re seeing?</p>
<p>Our society is terribly burdened by demands on our attention, distraction, and failure to be present.</p>
<p>Which makes the attached article all the more important. In his article, On <a href="https://hedgehogreview.com/issues/after-neoliberalism/articles/on-not-carrying-a-camera">Not Carrying a Camera</a>, John Rosenthal recounts what he learned when he photographed his child&rsquo;s birth: &ldquo;Over the next few days, I thought about my sonâ€™s birth. I was in the room when it happened, but was I really there, or had I been hiding behind my camera?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do hope you&rsquo;ll read his article. What moments do you wish you had been more present for?</p>
