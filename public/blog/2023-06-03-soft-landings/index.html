    <h1>Soft Landings</h1>
    
      <p class="author">By Mike Davis</p>
    
    <time>June 3, 2023</time>
    <p>Though thankfully very rare, sometimes during a flight, the engine stalls or the flaps stop working. Pilots of all planes train for these kinds of emergencies: stalls, problems with the flaps, bird strikes, instrument failures, and many others.</p>
<p>Similarly, our beliefs - our certainties - sometimes come crashing down around us. How we weather those storms is dependent on people who give us <em>soft landings</em>.</p>
<p>I was raised in an Evangelical Christian home. By definition, this means all other traditions are wrong, at least when it comes to faith. It is the <em>job</em> of Christians to help others see the errors of their faith and lead them to Christ. Through my twenties I was a Fundamentalist Christian, more hard-edged than the Evangelicals. Perhaps you can imagine all the things I found wrong about the world and life.</p>
<p>When our beliefs are so narrow, we often surround ourselves with those who believe the same thing. They are our <em>tribe</em>. We do everything in that narrow framework. We shut ourselves off from experiences that might connect us with others, with new ideas, and with a whole world of new stories and behaviors. Those who have different preferences in love, faith, and life choices are <em>anathema</em> to us (and, as we imagine it, God).</p>
<p>During and after seminary, in my chaplaincy training, I discovered more suffering than I could possibly have imagined. I learned all people want to live and love, all people suffer, and my belief that suffering was the result of all other worldviews was suspect.</p>
<p>Attending the death of the wife of a gay couple, I saw a depth of grief for which my training and beliefs didn&rsquo;t prepare me. The grief was so raw and real. My religious beliefs and my story to that date didn&rsquo;t prepare me to recognize that people love and care in different ways. I remember that moment as though it was yesterday. In those moments I first heard the structures of my belief-plane creaking mid-flight. Were my beliefs wrong?</p>
<p>Then, when my own life revealed it&rsquo;s rough edges, it was like the plane had stalled mid-flight. I was going to <em>crash-land</em>.</p>
<p>As the plane begins to waver, we hear it creaking, like the twisting of metal. The moment that fragile flying machine fails the test of reality, everything - our relationships (even marriages), practices, and belief constellation - comes falling down.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had many such moments when I saw myself and my beliefs for what they were. Prejudices coming to light. Cruelties. Judgments.</p>
<p>In those moments, we hope we can find people who will accept us with the fresh wounds of our awareness and shame. They alone can give us the <em>Soft Landings</em> we need.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had many people who&rsquo;ve been there for me in these moments of recognition, shame, and self-doubt. They&rsquo;ve heard my confessions (&ldquo;I feel like I need to say I&rsquo;m sorry for believing these things for so long. I carried these beliefs around and I&rsquo;m sure I hurt someone with these judgments. I&rsquo;m so sorry&rdquo;). And, they&rsquo;ve acknowledged our common humanity. They welcomed me as their searching spiritual kin.</p>
<p>For these people, I&rsquo;m eternally grateful. They gave me a <em>soft landing</em> when I desperately needed one.</p>
<p>When you are stalling or your flaps are failing, pray there&rsquo;s someone there to help you safely land.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at you, SI, CS, AS, JAC, and many others.</p>
<p>Thank you for being one of my soft landings. For seeing me. For accepting me.</p>
<p>Mike</p>
