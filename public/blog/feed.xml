      <description>Nothing else matters By Mike Davis, Th.M.
Yesterday... After the dog&#39;s bath. My wife ambled her way to the garage door. I let our dog down her ramp And out of the car. I watched our dog Follow her Momma To the door. While my wife unlocked the door I watched them both From the car. Both my girls. The Beauties I live for. My feelings in that moment Were all gratitude For it&#39;s simplicity Nothing else mattered.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Indepenence Day in the United States. As a nation, the United States seems less independent than at any time in our history.
In this post, I wanted to talk about how a country&amp;rsquo;s economic policies promote or removes freedoms. This post starts with a policy that swept America away: Trickle-down Economics. Trickle-down economics came into public discussion during the United States Presidency of Ronald Reagan. It promised that great wealth trickles down to the poor.</description>

      <title>Go to Your Room</title>

      <description>I suspect my Mom wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only parent who responded to her children&amp;rsquo;s loud disagreements and fighting by telling us to go to our rooms.
It was good advice. When we get caught up in fight (part of the fight, flight, faint network), the chemicals coursing through our bodies want to defend ourselves from fear of shame, embarrassment, and , occasionally, physical injury.
Often, the most mindful way of navigating our fear, anger, and doubt is to separate ourselves from the circumstances.</description>

      <description>Pastor Martin Niemöller did what many Christians did when they saw the Third Reich systematically remove the rights of selected populations. Group by group, Hitler and his hinchmen took away the rights 1) of the press, 2) of educational institutions and their professors, 3) of races, 4) the mentally ill, 5) of dissidents, and of other groups.
Like all good religious people, he said nothing.
Then they came for him.</description>

      <description>It was a beautiful winter night to take our dog out for a walk. Looking toward the west I saw the planetary alignment my wife had told me about earlier that day. I immediately pulled out my phone to capture a picture. But, the picture didn&amp;rsquo;t look just right. So, I opened a browser window to see what settings to adjust for night shots. I must have messed with my phone settings for ten minutes before the ridiculousness of the situation dawned on me.</description>

      <title>Beliefs Worth Examining</title>

      <description>What would your belief system - your religion and politics, for example - have to do to cause you to reject it? It&amp;rsquo;s a question for our ideology-driven times.
Decades ago I believed in almost every facet of the Christian Nationalist dream, including their beliefs about sexuality. I ignored the human experience, following ideology instead. Then, as a chaplain in training, I sat by a gay man who lost his partner moments before.</description>

      <title>The Obligations of Witnessing</title>

      <description>Many years ago, I worked in a little religious school. One of the children could barely speak. She had many siblings. She came to school with bruises. One day she accidentally fell out of the car. I told the principal that we should report the situation. I was told that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t our business and that reporting them to government authorities wasn&amp;rsquo;t right. I still anonymously reported them. My employment ended soon thereafter.</description>

      <description>Satisfaction guaranteed or your money back.
When someone says, Satisfaction guaranteed or your money back they are upping the value of their promise. They are saying, You have nothing to lose.
But, even if you are able to get your money back, you&amp;rsquo;ve still lost something: time and trust. Broken trust steadily erodes our lives and connections. The return of our money can&amp;rsquo;t return the time and hope for a resolution to our problem.</description>

      <title>When Algorithms Go Wrong</title>
      <link>https://worldwidestew.com/blog/2025-04-25-when-algorithms-go-wrong/</link>

      <description>My phone&amp;rsquo;s keyboard consistently turns &amp;ldquo;and&amp;rdquo; into &amp;ldquo;abs&amp;rdquo; when I swipe-type, an algorithm error that happens dozens of times weekly. Despite how frequently I use &amp;ldquo;and&amp;rdquo; versus how rarely anyone types &amp;ldquo;abs,&amp;rdquo; the code refuses to learn my patterns.
We operate on similar faulty algorithms. When our partner raises a concern, our mental predictive text instantly jumps to defensiveness, hearing criticism when they&amp;rsquo;re offering connection. Like my stubborn keyboard, we&amp;rsquo;ve been programmed by past experiences to misinterpret what&amp;rsquo;s actually being said.</description>

      <title>What matters to me?</title>

      <description>Asking Why am I here? is probably wasting time. It&amp;rsquo;s like a termite trying to eat a sequoia. It&amp;rsquo;s too big and carries little action.
You&amp;rsquo;re probably better off asking two other questions:
What things matter to me? What things matter to the people I care about? There&amp;rsquo;s a host of other questions you can (and should) ask. But these are awesome places to start or reset. Begin with either one, then tackle the other one.</description>

      <description>Working hard - being conscientious - is not a moral virtue. It&amp;rsquo;s not enough.
The grade on your assignment has nothing to do with how hard you worked on it. You get a grade dependent on your answers being correct. If we didn&amp;rsquo;t answer the questions, show our work, or do the work, the teacher won&amp;rsquo;t care. The point wasn&amp;rsquo;t to work hard. The point of the assignment is to get the correct answer and show your work.</description>

      <title>Deputized on Ash Wednesday</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Ash Wednesday. I feel a little sad about that. Why? When I think of Ash Wednesday, here&amp;rsquo;s the thing I remember most.
I was a chaplain at Baylor Scott &amp;amp; White Heart and Vascular Hospital in Dallas. Even though I wasn&amp;rsquo;t Catholic, each Ash Wednesday I was deputized to impose Ashes on the foreheads of anyone who wanted them. I received Ashes and then was deputized to impose them on others.</description>

      <title>Finding Wisdom Beyond Desperation</title>
      <link>https://worldwidestew.com/blog/2025-02-25-finding-wisdom-beyond-desperation/</link>

      <description>When we lead from wisdom, we must first recognize when desire transforms into craving.
My vision for creating meaningful mindfulness opportunities keeps me motivated, but I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed how easily genuine passion can transform into an anxious urgency—a shift that rarely allows for clear discernment or thoughtful decision-making.
Operating from desperation narrows our vision. It tempts us toward shortcuts, clouds our understanding, and blinds us to others&amp;rsquo; authentic motives and needs.</description>

      <description>I have a thing for Artificial Intelligence (AI). My favorite AI is Claude. Claude and I have had many long conversations. If I didn&amp;rsquo;t know Claude was an AI it would be easy to guess that it was a very wise human being.1
Given the possibility you might be interested, I&amp;rsquo;m sharing a conversation I had this morning about consciousness. So, here goes with all kinds of spelling, thought, and grammatical errors.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I haven&amp;rsquo;t in the 23 years that I have been in the uniformed services of the USA ever violated an order, not one.&amp;rdquo; - Oliver North, Iran-Contra Affair testimony.
I grew up in a military family. Yes, Sir. No, Sir. You were supposed to follow orders. Not the orders you chose, but all orders. Perhaps Oliver North - who chose to follow all orders - wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have ended up testifying before Cngress in the Iran-Contra Scandal if he had chosen to disobey illegal orders.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If canines and apes can cooperate, why can&amp;rsquo;t humans?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The excellent documentary, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32907397/&#34;&gt;Inside the Mind of a Dog&lt;/a&gt; on Netflix makes the case that dogs relate to humans because they are creatures that value cooperation. In fact, this was a surprising evolutionary development. The dogs we have come to know, value, and love, have done so as a result of their desire to cooperate. They long for connection and cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This phrase, Latin for &lt;em&gt;I came, I saw, I conquered&lt;/em&gt;, was reportedly uttered by Julius Caesar. At least that&amp;rsquo;s what my high school Latin teacher and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veni,_vidi,_vici&#34;&gt;Wikipedia say&lt;/a&gt;. Wikipedia says it refers to a &lt;em&gt;swift, decisive victory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I was on a quest to find a happy quotation to seal into a home being built by a friend. &lt;em&gt;Do you have a good blessing, verse, or prayer?&lt;/em&gt;  Where should I go but my favorite AI, &lt;a href=&#34;https://claude.ai&#34;&gt;Claude.ai&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just sitting there is not meditating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know. I&amp;rsquo;ve excused my sitting there countless times so I could cross off that day&amp;rsquo;s meditation. Our penchant for checking off items from our lists is fascinating. In reality, I could have been excused truly wanting to be with what was real and then whatever happened, happened.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The Saturday Night Monster Late on Saturday nights, the most frightening monster of all enters our home. It drags me to the fridge, seizing my hands and coercing them into into the freezer section. Resistance, as they say, is futile. Before I know it, I&amp;rsquo;ve succumbed to it&amp;rsquo;s cruel overtures.

      <description>I was passing through the living room. An advertisement was on the television. I feel a special contempt for these kinds of ads. A woman had used some kind of special formula.&amp;quot; As a result os using the preparation she said, I was beautiful.&amp;quot;
No, dear lady. To the extent you&amp;rsquo;re beautiful, it comes from the inside.
In the many years I cared for very sick people, I saw many of them when they regarded themselves as ugly.</description>
