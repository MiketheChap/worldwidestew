    <h1>Winning at the Shooting Range: layering for success</h1>
    
      <p class="author">By Mike Davis, Th.M., BCC, CWMF</p>
    
    <time>July 10, 2024</time>
    <p>Your success at the shooting range depends on the size of your target, distance from the target, the gun, your experience (pretty much nil for me), and many other conditions.</p>
<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t shoot (though I don&rsquo;t have <em>anything at all against shooting</em>, I don&rsquo;t shoot), there&rsquo;s something in this metophor that might help you.</p>
<p>Success, with shooting or practically anything else, depends on your process. We all need varying levels of success. We won&rsquo;&rsquo;t succeed at one thing all the time. So, we need to set multiple targets.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take the target range metphor again. Imagine you put your paper target six centimeters away from the end of your gun. You couldn&rsquo;t possibly miss. So, that won&rsquo;t do a lot for your self-esteem. But, it you set the target twenty feet away, it&rsquo;s not very challenging - but it could be just what you need for that day.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s good for humans to have multiple targets with varying levels of difficulty, time to completion, and varying levels of dependency.</p>
<p>We all have a mental report card. Let&rsquo;s look at mine for today. I&rsquo;m not going to assign a grade but I&rsquo;m going to assign how I feel toward myself as far as <em>hitting my target</em>. This isn&rsquo;t entirely fair.</p>
<p>No one joined a planned meditation session. There&rsquo;s a ton of reasons they couldn&rsquo;t attend: all of them are super-busy and uber-responsible people. There&rsquo;s no reason to feel any blame. But, you know humans are.</p>
<p>Right now, I have some trivial tasks to complete. They won&rsquo;t bring any great sense of accomplishment apart from checking them off my list (and keeping other family members happy).</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the tires and oil checked.</li>
<li>Prepare a meditation.</li>
</ol>
<p>I also have some shorter range but personally important tasks to complete.</p>
<ol>
<li>Transfer all my articles from my old website backup to my new website (here).</li>
<li>Make sure my new site looks good and functions well.</li>
<li>Complete the second class in my Positive Psychology class from the University of Pennsylvania (about two hours of work).</li>
<li>Do a little display for Halloween (breaks down into getting parts and then assembling parts).
Long term goals:</li>
<li>Complete one podcast within the next three weeks.</li>
<li>Plan for a second podcast.</li>
<li>Complete a learning session.</li>
</ol>
<p>My point here is this. There are lots of things I can be doing at any point in time. Almost all of them will improve my sense of thriving, health, happiness, and success.</p>
<p>If you want to feel more confidence and self-esteem, maintain multiple layers of activities (both pleasures and accomplishments). If something falls through, there are other things to pick you up. Move the targets moving. Also, take it a little easy on yourself.</p>
