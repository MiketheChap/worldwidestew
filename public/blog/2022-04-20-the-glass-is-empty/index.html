      <p class="author">By mike davis</p>
    
    <time>April 20, 2022</time>
    <p><em>The longer we live, the more apparent our wasted energy and time becomes. The alternative is focus and attention.</em></p>
<p>I just passed under a bridge over highway 75 in Dallas. As they frequently do, a group of staunch conservatives were preparing for rush hour traffic as people headed north. They will be there waving their flags, pointing, and hoisting their banners over the side of the bridge.</p>
<p>Economics and psychology suggest that they have some kind of <em>reward</em> experience in this demonstration. I guess that must be true. Probably, in some way it makes their glass feel full. Religiously or politically, there must be some satisfaction in this frequent ritual.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had my own similar experiences. Really, they kind of embarrass me. Did I or my other young peers seriously think that standing on a street corner with a Bible would change anybody&rsquo;s mind about God? More likely, those who witnessed my testimonies of God in my life shook their heads and wondered what does he get out of that? In what way does he seriously think he&rsquo;s making a difference in a world needing comfort, care, and compassion? As I watched those people with all their equipment on the bridge, I wondered the same thing. Do they seriously think that waving signs and placards and banners on a bridge over a highway changes lives?</p>
<p>In reality, I feel sad. At some point in time, even if their political agenda or religious agenda seems to succeed, the people for whom they campaign Will almost certainly leave them behind. Like all people, life with all of its vicissitudes will pass them by. Their kids, and perhaps they themselves, will look in the mirror one day and somberly ask <em>what was it all for</em>? Was there actually anything at all in the glass? Or was I just yelling to yell?</p>
<p>Mistakes happen. There&rsquo;s a long trail of them in my life. Through some sequence of events, and more likely good people, I&rsquo;m at a better place in my life. It&rsquo;s certainly not down to me. And, I&rsquo;m not done with my revelations of personal wasted energy.</p>
<p>I imagine that some of the big opportunities for parents, young people, and all of us, are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn from credible sources. Preferably, the great thinkers in your field of interest.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m stealing this one from Seth Godin. Practice your art. Practice practice practice.</li>
<li>Avoid shortcuts. This is related to the prior suggestion. There will be a lot of people who have a lot of great ideas about how you should spend your life. Many of them will try to sell you on get rich quick schemes. They will ask you to sell your friends and neighbors on some pyramid deal. And before you know it, you&rsquo;ll be waving flags and yelling at the cars below at the top of your voice. Of course, no one&rsquo;s seriously taking you serious.</li>
<li>Do work that matters. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be big work. But, if it&rsquo;s good work and it matters to you, and you can find a small group of people who are willing to pay you a living wage, then that is good work and it&rsquo;s worked at matters.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t cheapen yourself, the world in which you live, or things that matter.</li>
<li>Build trust, build relationships.</li>
</ul>
