    <h1>Eventually, if we&#39;re truly lucky</h1>
    
      <p class="author">By Mike Davis</p>
    
    <time>August 12, 2024</time>
    <p>Eventually,<br>
If we’re truly lucky,<br>
Our oft-repeated story about <em>What Happens Next</em><br>
Becomes boring, tiresome<br>
Even to us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve come to feel like
Being stuck in a pinball machine,
A game called <em>Broken Hopes</em><br>
Hit by paddle after paddle<br>
As if our pain<br>
Might invoke the Machine to Care.</p>
<p>The losses,<br>
The drama,<br>
The illness,<br>
What was wrong,
How so little was right,<br>
The constant state of pain,<br>
The search for <em>The Answer</em>,<br>
Or at least One Final,<br>
Causal,<br>
Explanation.
That is our demand.<br>
It is the price we demand<br>
If we are to depart from the<br>
Gates of Recrimination.</p>
<p>We live in a Desert.<br>
No relief in sight,<br>
Camped along an oasis,<br>
Now dried and vacant.
Surely, there’s a pill.<br>
A surgery.<br>
Some release from this story.</p>
<p>ANd, then, out of the Blue,<br>
We see the truth<br>
Our Off-told Story has no luster<br>
in the first place.
Still, piece by piece,<br>
And for obvious reasons.<br>
It became our plot,<br>
Our story,<br>
Our quest,<br>
Our search.<br>
We, being strung along.</p>
<p>Like a hym with only one refrain,<br>
I can’t,<br>
I tried that,<br>
Yeah, I know about that,<br>
You don’t understand.<br>
I’m looking for the answer,<br>
The <em>real</em> answer,<br>
A pill for my Story.<br>
But no one’s listening.<br>
They can&rsquo;t see me<br>
And my story.<br>
It&rsquo;s a puzzle without answer.   <br>
There must be a different way.</p>
<p>Then, if we’re lucky,<br>
At some unexpected time,<br>
In some unexpected way,<br>
Maybe while praying for release,<br>
Or dragging ourselves to do<br>
Some unwanted task,<br>
This burden of the Undesirable Story<br>
Sloughs away.<br>
Maybe, in that moment,<br>
We tire of it all. <br>
We realize there will never be <br>
The Magic Explanation.<br>
There will - though - be some relief,<br>
Seeing your pain and fragility,<br>
As a defining part of you,<br>
But not the Definition.</p>
<p>From that Desert Circle,<br>
You will leave behind,
A Monument to your pain,<br>
Your sorrow, and your Grief.</p>
<p>There will be a touch.<br>
It feels good.
We&rsquo;ve been seen without judgment,
And, we been loved.<br>
The Touch also burns with pain.<br>
How long has my Oft-Told Story<br>
And my search for the final Fix,<br>
Held me in its paralysis?</p>
<p>How long have you waited for<br>
A gentle coaxing<br>
To come out and play<br>
From someone who sees you <br>
And respects when you&rsquo;ve finished<br>
For today?</p>
<p>These small things<br>
Become a lifeline<br>
Fragile and tender.<br>
You hold them in moments,<br>
Seconds,<br>
Fearful they will break.<br>
Sometimes, they do.<br>
Will my brief moments of<br>
Joy then diasppear?</p>
<p>But, the false promises of cures<br>
That never arrive,<br>
And start to dissolve.<br>
You decide the False Hope,<br>
Is No Hope at all.<br>
It&rsquo;s not enough.<br>
The small moments,<br>
The ones tinged with Blue,<br>
And sun-dappled Golden hues,<br>
And Greens.<br>
Become the Momentous Moments.<br>
These are enough.</p>
<p>Eventually,<br>
If we’re <em>truly lucky</em>,<br>
Our oft-repeated story about <em>What Happens Next</em> <br>
Becomes boring, tiresome,<br>
Even to us.<br>
We settle into the vast beauty
lying before us.
What is possible
When we release our white-knuckled grasp
And step into what is possible
When we&rsquo;ve let go.</p>
<p>&ndash; Michael Davis
(Note: I usually post my meditations right after I write them. This one comes from specific love for the people I&rsquo;ve visited as a chaplain and known as friends. It also derives from my own life experiences. My hesitation related to my fear that reasders would feel their pain was minimized. I would never want to minimize your pain and your experience of it. We are all on a continual spectrum of change, growth, and acceptance.)</p>
