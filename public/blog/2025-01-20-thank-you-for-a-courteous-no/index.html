    <h1>Thank you for a courteous No</h1>
    
      <p class="author">By Mike Davis, Th.M, BCC, CWMF</p>
    
    <time>January 20, 2025</time>
    <p>Thank you for a courteous No.</p>
<p>Were recently visited the Disney District at Anaheim. We&rsquo;d been told that we could take our dog inside that area. As we walked toward the entry, a Security Guard approached us. He addressed us kindly and with a smile. No <em>power dynamics on display.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Do you mind if I ask you you follks a couple of questions? I&rsquo;d like to save you a few steps if I can.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He asked the service dog qualification questions to see if Cassie was a qualified service dog under federal law.</p>
<p>As it turned out, dogs are not allowed in the Disney District unless they are service dogs. The security guard did save us steps.</p>
<p>The security guard framed things in a way where:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nothing was harsh or adversarial. To the contrary, he was friendly, kind and respectful. <em>You&rsquo;all seem like smart folks and you clearly know the rules about service dogs. So, it&rsquo;s just something to think about.</em></li>
<li>He was helping us <em>save a few steps</em>.</li>
<li>He didn&rsquo;t issue a <em>Hard No</em>. Instead, he said, <em>You&rsquo;all look pretty smart so I&rsquo;ll just leave it with you</em>. The implication was that the <em>Hard No</em> was probably coming if we kept going or if we lied.</li>
<li>He <em>prepared</em> us for what to expect if we continued.</li>
</ol>
<p>Modern society is constantly on <em>fight or flight</em> mode. We are always playing <em>zero-sum</em> games where there are <em>only</em> winners and losers.</p>
<p><em>Why must things be this way?</em></p>
<p>It is possible to - even in the presence of polarized policies, rules, and barriers - to act with restraint, kindness, respect, and understanding. We can all bend. We all think we&rsquo;re defending some great principle. <br>
<br>
Save your energy for the real principle. Until then, settle in with your dog next to you in the car, outside Anaheim&rsquo;s Disney District and read a food book. In our <em>continual fight-or-flight state, we&rsquo;re burning up way too much energy on things that really don&rsquo;t matter.</em></p>
