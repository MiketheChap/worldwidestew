    <h1>On the end of a family vacation</h1>
    
      <p class="author">By mike davis</p>
    
    <time>April 16, 2024</time>
    <p>On the end of a family vacation</p>
<p>It had been a while since we&rsquo;d seen each other. Age has crept up on us. We have our differences now that the world is different. Still, there was goodness, laughter, and kindess. And, perhaps&hellip; The wonder that always occurs when family parts from one another??</p>
<p><em>The time of anticipation<br>
Of preparation<br>
Of travel<br>
Of planning, savoring, recollecting<br>
Of the knowledge<br>
From the first night<br>
Until the last<br>
Where we look<br>
In the rear view mirror<br>
And take the turn out of the circle<br>
Onto the highway</em></p>
<p><em>Be with this sadness.<br>
Stay here for a while.<br>
Avoid the phone.<br>
The book.<br>
Or whatever it is<br>
We do to salve hard feelings.<br>
Be present with them.<br>
They are our Teacher<br>
About What Matters.<br>
About What has given us strength.<br>
About Where we can return<br>
When things get hard.<br>
The comfort and sadness are twins.<br>
We can’t live without both.</em></p>
<p><em>Every culture has a way of parting:<br>
Letters<br>
Stone markers<br>
Prayers<br>
Gifts</em></p>
<p><em>These are all reminders of<br>
The leaving we do each day<br>
That which we take for granted<br>
The hug,<br>
The kiss,<br>
The putting away of what we used<br>
The cleaning up.</em></p>
<p><em>In this gathering together, we were reminded<br>
Of who we were<br>
Of who we are<br>
Of how we’ve stayed the same<br>
Of how we’ve changed<br>
Of what we were together<br>
Of who we are together right now</em></p>
<p><em>Sometimes, being present<br>
Right here, right now<br>
Evokes memories,<br>
Uncertainties,<br>
Hopes for things yet to come,<br>
And the bonds of connections<br>
That have gone before</em></p>
<p><em>Together,<br>
In this book called Family<br>
We write our History,<br>
Past,<br>
And we have each dog-eared the corner of this page.<br>
A Bookmark.</em></p>
<p><em>As much as any marker<br>
We could possibly leave<br>
This time together was invocationn<br>
And elegy<br>
For each other<br>
For all of us together <br>
For our pasts, presents, and futures.</em></p>
<p><em>Whatever you face, <br>
Wherever you go, <br>
If you sat around this table<br>
Whoever and whatever you are<br>
Human or dog<br>
If you looked at old pictures<br>
Or used the old cup measure<br>
Or tasted recipes drawn from an ancient book<br>
or pencil-scribed postcard<br>
You are family<br>
You are held in our tenuous Bonds<br>
Bonds of past, present, and future<br>
This initiation or continuance<br>
And its stories are forever yours</em></p>
<p><em>We impart on you a Sacred Wish<br>
May you live in safety<br>
In peace<br>
Held in gentle love<br>
May you, in whatever journeys<br>
Come your way,<br>
In THAT moment,<br>
Hold these moments<br>
As Sacred Reminders<br>
That You are Loved.<br>
Held tightly<br>
Irrevocably<br>
In the shared, passionate love,<br>
That has surrounded you here.<br>
You are loved.<br>
Return here when you doubt.</em></p>
