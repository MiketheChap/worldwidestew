    <h1>Can I help you?</h1>
    
      <p class="author">By mike davis</p>
    
    <time>August 18, 2024</time>
    <p>I went to Big Box store to buy some parts.</p>
<p>There was a very cheerful gentleman who asked if he could help. His demeanor, warmth, and kindness was sincere. So, I tried to explain to him what I wanted to do.</p>
<p><em>We don&rsquo;t have anything like that here in plumbing. Check hardware.</em></p>
<p>I went to hardware. He was equally cheerful and wanted to help. I repeated what I hoped to accomplish and what I needed.</p>
<p><em>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going to have anything like that. Maybe plumbing can help.</em></p>
<p>I genuinely appreciated the sincere effort to help.</p>
<p>Helping, though, requires a step beyond willingness. It requires listening to learn what people want and need.</p>
<p><em>Correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong. But, it sounds like you want to safely disconnect a dishwasher so you can remove it. Then, when you get a new dishwasher, you&rsquo;ll be all set to reconnect it. Is that right?</em></p>
<p>The step of listening and clarifying allows the next stage of helping.</p>
<p>We got through step one just fine. But after that, it fizzled out. I didn&rsquo;t have the right words to connect with them. They didn&rsquo;t really ask questions that would clarify.</p>
<p>Most of us don&rsquo;t know what we want when we&rsquo;re dealing with something outside out skillset. If we want to help, we need to be patient enough to figure out what people really want.</p>
