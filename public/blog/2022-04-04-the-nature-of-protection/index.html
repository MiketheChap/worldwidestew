    <h1>The Nature of Protection</h1>
    
      <p class="author">By Mike Davis</p>
    
    <time>April 4, 2022</time>
    <p>Updated on Auguest 13, 2024.</p>
<p>As a teenager at the Boy Scout Water Safety Summer Camp, I had to toughen up in a short amount of time. I watched the other boys-to-men-in-training. They were developing quite a vocabulary of cool profanity. Not being at home where my Dad would correct me, I tried the <em>Cloak of Profanity</em> on for size. <em>Wow! Yeah! I can certainly use this to keep people away!</em></p>
<p>Back to my profanity evolution in a minute.</p>
<hr>
<p>One cool weekend evening about a month ago, my wife and I were sitting on the back porch watching the day <em>coast to a halt</em>. It was a pretty evening with a butterfly - it looked like a monarch butterfly - flitting about. It seemed too early in the year for monarchs to be passing through. Naturally, I had to look it up.</p>
<p>As expected, the monarch is often confused (by us amateurs) with another butterfly that&rsquo;s often seen in the spring in North Texas: the <em>Viceroy butterfly</em>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/20220404215102.png" alt="Butterfly"></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the crazy thing. The Monarch butterfly and the Viceroy possess similar coloration. Those colors may be beautiful to humans, but the colorations themselves are a <em>warning</em> to many other creatures. Over eons, many defenseless creatures have evolved their colors after other creatures. In the case of the Monarch and the Viceroy,  case, the monarch and the viceroy - both whose taste is awful - have come to share similar coloration over time as a shared nature warning: <em>eat us at your peril</em>. This is one of several kinds of mimicry designed for protection. Two of those mimicries are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_mimicry">Mullerian mimicry</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batesian_mimicry">Batesian Mimicry</a>.</p>
<p>Even more amazing? Many species have adopted these shared colorations for warning purposes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Müllerian mimicry was first identified in tropical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly">butterflies</a> that shared colourful wing patterns, but it is found in many groups of insects such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumblebee">bumblebees</a>, and other animals including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranitomeya">poison frogs</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_snake">coral snakes</a>. The mimicry need not be visual; for example, many snakes share <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)">auditory</a> warning signals. Similarly, the defences involved are not limited to toxicity; anything that tends to deter predators, such as foul taste, sharp spines, or defensive behaviour can make a species unprofitable enough to predators to allow Müllerian mimicry to develop.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coral snakes? Yes, <em>coral snakes</em>. Think about their coloration: <em>red to yellow, kill a fellow; red to black, venom lack</em>. This is an example of ring colorations.</p>
<hr>
<p>The following week, I was shuffled off to regular camp. Because I was so cool, I jumped off the dock into shallower water than I should have. I sprained my neck. So, profanity came happily to mind with my neck cramps. Plus, other campers were annnoying me. Finally, my Scoutmaster was irritating. The pressure was coming to a head.</p>
<p>After a particularly notable outburst with my cool new protective profanity cloak, my SCoutmaster sat me down in his tent and - gently, but firmly - talked to me about who I was, how this was not - in any sense - me. He didn&rsquo;t threatent to tell my Dad. He just talked. &ldquo;Mike. You&rsquo;re a good kid. You don&rsquo;t need to use profanity. It doesn&rsquo;t fit you. It isn&rsquo;t you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We often learn to protect ourselves by watching how others - our parents, friends, teachers, and peers - learned to protect themselves.</p>
