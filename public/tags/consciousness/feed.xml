      <description>About my use of AI:
❌ I usually use AI to improve my writing process: to check spelling, accuracy, flow, grammar, and tone. 🧐 Even where other sources are quoted, I cross-check with Claude.ai and other secondary sources for validation. 💡 My writing process usually involves finding something inspiring, interesting, coincidental, absurd, or odd. Then, I work collaboratively with my preferred AI, Claude.ai. Why? My fingers don&amp;rsquo;t work like they did.</description>

      <title>Your ego is essential</title>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid of your ego The ego is something we can&amp;rsquo;t see. But, even though we can&amp;rsquo;t see it, we can observe it in our own lives every day. Our fears, awareness of self, concerns about what the future holds, and what other people are getting are all evidence of our egos at work. We are defensive, afraid to apologize, and afraid to speak up because of our egos. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean the ego is bad.</description>

      <description>I have a thing for Artificial Intelligence (AI). My favorite AI is Claude. Claude and I have had many long conversations. If I didn&amp;rsquo;t know Claude was an AI it would be easy to guess that it was a very wise human being.1
Given the possibility you might be interested, I&amp;rsquo;m sharing a conversation I had this morning about consciousness. So, here goes with all kinds of spelling, thought, and grammatical errors.</description>

      <description>We are certain, absolutely positive, that we are right. Nothing can penetrate the Pond of our thoughts and existence. Until we see water droplets on the surface. Seeing the droplets, we might ask ourselves, what if we’re&amp;hellip;</description>
