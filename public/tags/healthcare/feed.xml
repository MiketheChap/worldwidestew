      <description>This week’s featured articles
From Harvard Business Review. Do you have a phone addiction? - uhh, probably. Now, do something about it. What happens when hospitals aren’t appropriately funded? They often turn to funding from Private Equity firms. What happens then? It’s not good and costs patients and society. Read this article from Harvard. </description>

      <title>Deep Dive: A questionable iOS feature; US Disease Burden from plastics; interesting recent articles</title>

      <description>A review of news I find interesting. 1. An iOS &lt;em&gt;feature&lt;/em&gt; you might want to fix. 2. It&amp;rsquo;s taken a long time for plastics to create what many believe will create significant human disease burden. That ship has gathered substantial steam. 3. Possiblle harms related to mindfulness (if your going to be in a mindfulness group, make sure the leader is qualified). 4. Watch out for marketing using &lt;em&gt;neuro&lt;/em&gt;: they may be trying to get into your head. 5. A compassion therapy that can boost &lt;em&gt;expansiveness&lt;/em&gt;? That just blows my mind (if it turns out to be good research).</description>
