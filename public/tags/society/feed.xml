      <description>Many years ago, I worked in a little religious school. One of the children could barely speak. She had many siblings. She came to school with bruises. One day she accidentally fell out of the car. I told the principal that we should report the situation. I was told that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t our business and that reporting them to government authorities wasn&amp;rsquo;t right. I still anonymously reported them. My employment ended soon thereafter.</description>
