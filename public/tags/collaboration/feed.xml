      <description>About my use of AI:
❌ I usually use AI to improve my writing process: to check spelling, accuracy, flow, grammar, and tone. 🧐 Even where other sources are quoted, I cross-check with Claude.ai and other secondary sources for validation. 💡 My writing process usually involves finding something inspiring, interesting, coincidental, absurd, or odd. Then, I work collaboratively with my preferred AI, Claude.ai. Why? My fingers don&amp;rsquo;t work like they did.</description>

      <description>When we lead from wisdom, we must first recognize when desire transforms into craving.
My vision for creating meaningful mindfulness opportunities keeps me motivated, but I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed how easily genuine passion can transform into an anxious urgency—a shift that rarely allows for clear discernment or thoughtful decision-making.
Operating from desperation narrows our vision. It tempts us toward shortcuts, clouds our understanding, and blinds us to others&amp;rsquo; authentic motives and needs.</description>
