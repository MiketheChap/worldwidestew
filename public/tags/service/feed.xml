      <description>When I started Worldwide Stew, I intended the Blog area of the site to be generally positive in tone. I would reserve the Opinion area of the site for news and opinions about science, health, politics, and fun stuff.
And then we ended up with what can only be called a fascist Administration(Merriam-Webster definition at the link). At this point, the scaffolding that held up any form of democracy is quickly eroding, like hurricane-force winds along the shoreline.</description>

      <description>Asking Why am I here? is probably wasting time. It&amp;rsquo;s like a termite trying to eat a sequoia. It&amp;rsquo;s too big and carries little action.
You&amp;rsquo;re probably better off asking two other questions:
What things matter to me? What things matter to the people I care about? There&amp;rsquo;s a host of other questions you can (and should) ask. But these are awesome places to start or reset. Begin with either one, then tackle the other one.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Ash Wednesday. I feel a little sad about that. Why? When I think of Ash Wednesday, here&amp;rsquo;s the thing I remember most.
I was a chaplain at Baylor Scott &amp;amp; White Heart and Vascular Hospital in Dallas. Even though I wasn&amp;rsquo;t Catholic, each Ash Wednesday I was deputized to impose Ashes on the foreheads of anyone who wanted them. I received Ashes and then was deputized to impose them on others.</description>
