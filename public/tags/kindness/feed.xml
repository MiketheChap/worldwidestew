      <description>The first person to whom you should be kind is yourself.
You might think I&amp;rsquo;m talking about narcissism. I&amp;rsquo;m not. A narcissist is an extremely self-centered person who has an exaggerated sense of self-importance. By definition, they don&amp;rsquo;t find it hard to be unkind to themselves.
It&amp;rsquo;s hard for me to write about this because I often feel unkind to myself. I&amp;rsquo;m learning, though, that a lack of self-compassion is harmful to everyone who surrounds the self-judgemental person.</description>

      <description>Pastor Martin Niemöller did what many Christians did when they saw the Third Reich systematically remove the rights of selected populations. Group by group, Hitler and his hinchmen took away the rights 1) of the press, 2) of educational institutions and their professors, 3) of races, 4) the mentally ill, 5) of dissidents, and of other groups.
Like all good religious people, he said nothing.
Then they came for him.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Veni, Vidi, Vici&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phrase, Latin for &lt;em&gt;I came, I saw, I conquered&lt;/em&gt;, was reportedly uttered by Julius Caesar. At least that&amp;rsquo;s what my high school Latin teacher and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veni,_vidi,_vici&#34;&gt;Wikipedia say&lt;/a&gt;. Wikipedia says it refers to a &lt;em&gt;swift, decisive victory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
