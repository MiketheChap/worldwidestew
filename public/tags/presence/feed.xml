      <description>During a meditation today, right when I was getting into my space of mental clarity, a notification came through.
It&amp;rsquo;s good online meeting etiquette to mute ourselves when we join meetings, unless you&amp;rsquo;re hosting the meeting.
But, we might also take the next step and turn off our notifications. If you&amp;rsquo;re on iOS (Apple) these are found under your Focus settings.
Don&amp;rsquo;t be like me. Avoid interruptions right when you get into the Zone.</description>

      <description>It was a beautiful winter night to take our dog out for a walk. Looking toward the west I saw the planetary alignment my wife had told me about earlier that day. I immediately pulled out my phone to capture a picture. But, the picture didn&amp;rsquo;t look just right. So, I opened a browser window to see what settings to adjust for night shots. I must have messed with my phone settings for ten minutes before the ridiculousness of the situation dawned on me.</description>
