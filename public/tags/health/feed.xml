      <description>Cassie, let’s go for a walk.
Cassie, our dog responds more slowly than usual. She usually gets to the door first. She&amp;rsquo;s feeling lazy this morning. Finally, at another beckon, she arises. But, as she does, she takes a long, deep stretch. Her body lengthens. She twists like her body is a towel being wrung out. Then, she releases a full-body shake.
Now, she was ready to go. Our walk could begin.</description>

      <description>A review of news I find interesting. 1. An iOS &lt;em&gt;feature&lt;/em&gt; you might want to fix. 2. It&amp;rsquo;s taken a long time for plastics to create what many believe will create significant human disease burden. That ship has gathered substantial steam. 3. Possiblle harms related to mindfulness (if your going to be in a mindfulness group, make sure the leader is qualified). 4. Watch out for marketing using &lt;em&gt;neuro&lt;/em&gt;: they may be trying to get into your head. 5. A compassion therapy that can boost &lt;em&gt;expansiveness&lt;/em&gt;? That just blows my mind (if it turns out to be good research).</description>
