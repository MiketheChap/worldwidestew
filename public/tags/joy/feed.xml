      <description>Nothing else matters By Mike Davis, Th.M.
Yesterday... After the dog&#39;s bath. My wife ambled her way to the garage door. I let our dog down her ramp And out of the car. I watched our dog Follow her Momma To the door. While my wife unlocked the door I watched them both From the car. Both my girls. The Beauties I live for. My feelings in that moment Were all gratitude For it&#39;s simplicity Nothing else mattered.</description>
