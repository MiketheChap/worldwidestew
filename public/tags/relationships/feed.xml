      <description>I suspect my Mom wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only parent who responded to her children&amp;rsquo;s loud disagreements and fighting by telling us to go to our rooms.
It was good advice. When we get caught up in fight (part of the fight, flight, faint network), the chemicals coursing through our bodies want to defend ourselves from fear of shame, embarrassment, and , occasionally, physical injury.
Often, the most mindful way of navigating our fear, anger, and doubt is to separate ourselves from the circumstances.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If canines and apes can cooperate, why can&amp;rsquo;t humans?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The excellent documentary, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32907397/&#34;&gt;Inside the Mind of a Dog&lt;/a&gt; on Netflix makes the case that dogs relate to humans because they are creatures that value cooperation. In fact, this was a surprising evolutionary development. The dogs we have come to know, value, and love, have done so as a result of their desire to cooperate. They long for connection and cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
