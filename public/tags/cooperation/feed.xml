      <description>When we lead from wisdom, we must first recognize when desire transforms into craving.
My vision for creating meaningful mindfulness opportunities keeps me motivated, but I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed how easily genuine passion can transform into an anxious urgency—a shift that rarely allows for clear discernment or thoughtful decision-making.
Operating from desperation narrows our vision. It tempts us toward shortcuts, clouds our understanding, and blinds us to others&amp;rsquo; authentic motives and needs.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If canines and apes can cooperate, why can&amp;rsquo;t humans?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The excellent documentary, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32907397/&#34;&gt;Inside the Mind of a Dog&lt;/a&gt; on Netflix makes the case that dogs relate to humans because they are creatures that value cooperation. In fact, this was a surprising evolutionary development. The dogs we have come to know, value, and love, have done so as a result of their desire to cooperate. They long for connection and cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
