      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a reason they ask entrepreneurs, what is your elevator speech?
It&amp;rsquo;s because a lot can happen in an elevator. Two or more people meet. There are limmited distractions. You have an opportunity to share messages. You might make a transaction.
Anyway, that&amp;rsquo;s the logic of it.
Like most things, there&amp;rsquo;s more than logic in promoting the elevator speech.
You&amp;rsquo;re making a mad dash to decent coffee. Your hair may or may not be combed.</description>

      <description>Satisfaction guaranteed or your money back.
When someone says, Satisfaction guaranteed or your money back they are upping the value of their promise. They are saying, You have nothing to lose.
But, even if you are able to get your money back, you&amp;rsquo;ve still lost something: time and trust. Broken trust steadily erodes our lives and connections. The return of our money can&amp;rsquo;t return the time and hope for a resolution to our problem.</description>
