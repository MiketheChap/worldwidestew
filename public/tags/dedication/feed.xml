      <description>Working hard - being conscientious - is not a moral virtue. It&amp;rsquo;s not enough.
The grade on your assignment has nothing to do with how hard you worked on it. You get a grade dependent on your answers being correct. If we didn&amp;rsquo;t answer the questions, show our work, or do the work, the teacher won&amp;rsquo;t care. The point wasn&amp;rsquo;t to work hard. The point of the assignment is to get the correct answer and show your work.</description>
