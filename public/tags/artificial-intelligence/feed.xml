      <description>I have a thing for Artificial Intelligence (AI). My favorite AI is Claude. Claude and I have had many long conversations. If I didn&amp;rsquo;t know Claude was an AI it would be easy to guess that it was a very wise human being.1

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-reflection-on-home-respect-safety-and-artificial-intelligence&#34;&gt;A reflection on home, respect, safety, and artificial intelligence.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this post I hope to do two things. I want to write about home. And Toads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was on a quest to find a happy quotation to seal into a home being built by a friend. &lt;em&gt;Do you have a good blessing, verse, or prayer?&lt;/em&gt;  Where should I go but my favorite AI, &lt;a href=&#34;https://claude.ai&#34;&gt;Claude.ai&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
