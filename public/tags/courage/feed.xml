      <description>Imagine you&amp;rsquo;re asked to fetch a ball. Without arms or legs. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry. I can&amp;rsquo;t. In fact, the very fact that you ask is is insulting and cruel.
But, is it possible we could, at the very least, contemplate working it out: how could I fetch a ball without arms or legs?
We&amp;rsquo;ll come back to that in a second.
Do animals play? Yes, it seems some do. But, you have to take into account the definition of play.</description>

      <description>I think I was unfailingly gentle with patients, let them rant, and tolerated their abuses. Eventually, their rant lost steam and we started to get to the core of their often legitimate frustrations. They might be directed at an unrealized hope for a dreamed of healing. Or, they might feel they weren&amp;rsquo;t understood. A pinhole in a balloon release pressurized air madly at first out of a pricked balloon. Then, the balloon eventually loses pressure and falls to the floor.</description>

      <description>Many years ago, I worked in a little religious school. One of the children could barely speak. She had many siblings. She came to school with bruises. One day she accidentally fell out of the car. I told the principal that we should report the situation. I was told that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t our business and that reporting them to government authorities wasn&amp;rsquo;t right. I still anonymously reported them. My employment ended soon thereafter.</description>
