      <description>I suspect my Mom wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only parent who responded to her children&amp;rsquo;s loud disagreements and fighting by telling us to go to our rooms.
It was good advice. When we get caught up in fight (part of the fight, flight, faint network), the chemicals coursing through our bodies want to defend ourselves from fear of shame, embarrassment, and , occasionally, physical injury.
Often, the most mindful way of navigating our fear, anger, and doubt is to separate ourselves from the circumstances.</description>
