      <description>Just Start Mindfulness Meditation Sessions New podcast episode coming soon - I&amp;rsquo;m editing a podcast episode I recorded with a friend, Anthony, who&amp;rsquo;s a nurse. We talk about travel, culture, nursing, and the role of chaplains (among other things). Here&amp;rsquo;s the Apple podcasts link
Book Reviews - In the next few months, I plan to host a book review with a friend and colleague, Andres. My thought is to host an online discussion with a guest while having participants join us on this website&amp;rsquo;s Discord.</description>

      <description>This week we consider recent research on mindfulness showing distinct patterns of contemplative practive help well-being. We also look at an article on the death experience during CPR. Maybe we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t blow off those near-death experiences so quickly.</description>
