      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just sitting there is not meditating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know. I&amp;rsquo;ve excused my sitting there countless times so I could cross off that day&amp;rsquo;s meditation. Our penchant for checking off items from our lists is fascinating. In reality, I could have been excused truly wanting to be with what was real and then whatever happened, happened.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This week we look at psychological well-being - including from the U.S. Surgeon General, paying attention to the experience of detransitioners, exposomics, silence and epigenetics, Buddhism (religion or not), and my bone to pick with the &lt;em&gt;Humanist Chaplaincy Network&lt;/em&gt; (I&amp;rsquo;m not picking any bones with humanist chaplains).</description>

      <description>This week we consider recent research on mindfulness showing distinct patterns of contemplative practive help well-being. We also look at an article on the death experience during CPR. Maybe we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t blow off those near-death experiences so quickly.</description>
