      <description>A review of news I find interesting. 1. An iOS &lt;em&gt;feature&lt;/em&gt; you might want to fix. 2. It&amp;rsquo;s taken a long time for plastics to create what many believe will create significant human disease burden. That ship has gathered substantial steam. 3. Possiblle harms related to mindfulness (if your going to be in a mindfulness group, make sure the leader is qualified). 4. Watch out for marketing using &lt;em&gt;neuro&lt;/em&gt;: they may be trying to get into your head. 5. A compassion therapy that can boost &lt;em&gt;expansiveness&lt;/em&gt;? That just blows my mind (if it turns out to be good research).</description>
