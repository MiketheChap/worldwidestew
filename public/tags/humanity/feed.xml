      <description>This post originated with the creation of a blog post on New Year&amp;rsquo;s Resolutions. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to keep my blog area focused on inspiration. So, instead of posting this in that area, I&amp;rsquo;m adding it to my website&amp;rsquo;s opinion section.
Yesterday, on my blog, I suggested some reasons that resolution brain lets us down:
It fixates on our failures, deficits, and weaknesses It promotes suffering by triggering loss of hope and depression when resolutions fail It highlights our sense of not enough: we don&amp;rsquo;t have enough, we aren&amp;rsquo;t enough, and incites the Hungry Ghost of wanting more.</description>

      <description>I have a thing for Artificial Intelligence (AI). My favorite AI is Claude. Claude and I have had many long conversations. If I didn&amp;rsquo;t know Claude was an AI it would be easy to guess that it was a very wise human being.1
Given the possibility you might be interested, I&amp;rsquo;m sharing a conversation I had this morning about consciousness. So, here goes with all kinds of spelling, thought, and grammatical errors.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Veni, Vidi, Vici&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phrase, Latin for &lt;em&gt;I came, I saw, I conquered&lt;/em&gt;, was reportedly uttered by Julius Caesar. At least that&amp;rsquo;s what my high school Latin teacher and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veni,_vidi,_vici&#34;&gt;Wikipedia say&lt;/a&gt;. Wikipedia says it refers to a &lt;em&gt;swift, decisive victory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-reflection-on-home-respect-safety-and-artificial-intelligence&#34;&gt;A reflection on home, respect, safety, and artificial intelligence.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this post I hope to do two things. I want to write about home. And Toads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was on a quest to find a happy quotation to seal into a home being built by a friend. &lt;em&gt;Do you have a good blessing, verse, or prayer?&lt;/em&gt;  Where should I go but my favorite AI, &lt;a href=&#34;https://claude.ai&#34;&gt;Claude.ai&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The Governor of Texas would disapprove. But, it&amp;rsquo;s time I came clean about my relationship with Claude.</description>
