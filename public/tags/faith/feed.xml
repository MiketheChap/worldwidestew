      <description>What would your belief system - your religion and politics, for example - have to do to cause you to reject it? It&amp;rsquo;s a question for our ideology-driven times.
Decades ago I believed in almost every facet of the Christian Nationalist dream, including their beliefs about sexuality. I ignored the human experience, following ideology instead. Then, as a chaplain in training, I sat by a gay man who lost his partner moments before.</description>

      <description>Working hard - being conscientious - is not a moral virtue. It&amp;rsquo;s not enough.
The grade on your assignment has nothing to do with how hard you worked on it. You get a grade dependent on your answers being correct. If we didn&amp;rsquo;t answer the questions, show our work, or do the work, the teacher won&amp;rsquo;t care. The point wasn&amp;rsquo;t to work hard. The point of the assignment is to get the correct answer and show your work.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Ash Wednesday. I feel a little sad about that. Why? When I think of Ash Wednesday, here&amp;rsquo;s the thing I remember most.
I was a chaplain at Baylor Scott &amp;amp; White Heart and Vascular Hospital in Dallas. Even though I wasn&amp;rsquo;t Catholic, each Ash Wednesday I was deputized to impose Ashes on the foreheads of anyone who wanted them. I received Ashes and then was deputized to impose them on others.</description>
