      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Ash Wednesday. I feel a little sad about that. Why? When I think of Ash Wednesday, here&amp;rsquo;s the thing I remember most.
I was a chaplain at Baylor Scott &amp;amp; White Heart and Vascular Hospital in Dallas. Even though I wasn&amp;rsquo;t Catholic, each Ash Wednesday I was deputized to impose Ashes on the foreheads of anyone who wanted them. I received Ashes and then was deputized to impose them on others.</description>
