      <description>This post originated with the creation of a blog post on New Year&amp;rsquo;s Resolutions. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to keep my blog area focused on inspiration. So, instead of posting this in that area, I&amp;rsquo;m adding it to my website&amp;rsquo;s opinion section.

      <description>We all want to believe in the impossible. We, you and me, will never die. Or, at best, it&amp;rsquo;s will be far into the future: we don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about it now.
