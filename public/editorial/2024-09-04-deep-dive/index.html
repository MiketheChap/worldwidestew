<li><a href="https://ncase.me/trust/">The Evolution of Trust</a> - Many of our modern discussions foment fear and rage. They avoid trust of those outside our nation (unless they have some kind of <em>quid pro quo</em> relationship with them). But there are ways to balance fear and trust. These methods are based in <em>Game Theory</em>. THe link provided here demonstrates the value and importance of trust in a visual, clear, and incontrovertible way. I hope you&rsquo;ll let this <em>prove</em> to you that trust is the first step to a better, safer, and more resilient world that values safety, rational fear, and trust. Don&rsquo;t believe the partisans who are trying to make political hay. Please, give this a look!</li>
<li>The Texas religious right wing continues it&rsquo;s quest to push policy toward their version of Christianity.  Among the measures they are pushing:
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/02/07/greg-abbott-diversity-equity-inclusion-illegal/">Gov. Greg Abbott tells state agencies to stop considering diversity in hiring</a> (Source: Texas Tribune)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/29/greg-abott-texas-governor-mexico-border-asylum-seekers-risk">Deadly buoys, razor wires, armed guards: Greg Abbott is fixated on keeping migrants out</a> (Source: The Guardian). In order to keep immigrants out of the United States, Abbott has placed barrels with attached razor-wire in the Rio Grande. There are reports of men, women (even pregnant women), and children being <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/18/us/texas-troopers-migrant-treatment-concerns/index.html">pushed back through razor wire and refused water</a> (Source: CNN). This is reprehensible. HOw does this mentality fit with <em>right to life</em>? What must it do to the soul/psyche of the person/s who assemble those barrels with razor wire. It would be a great job to tell your children about, huh?</li>
<li><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/09/03/texas-transgender-birth-certificates/">State health department blocks transgender Texans from changing sex on birth certificates</a> (Source: Texas Tribune) - Why does this matter, you ask? Birth certificates and driver&rsquo;s licenses are official documents and inform the medical care of patients. Trans-gender patients have specialized healthcare needs and risks. Incorrect documentation places them at risk. How, in good conscience, can we incorrectly list the patient&rsquo;s status? Again, this is a <em>respect of life</em> issue, as well as liberty.</li>
<li>Pregnancy, abortion access, and women&rsquo;s rights - As reported in the <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/12/07/texas-emergency-abortion-lawsuit/">Texas Tribune</a> the Texas <em>religious right</em> positions on matters related to pregnancy, abortion access, and women&rsquo;s rights have little to do with meaningful respect of life. Texas religious conservatives are not interested in the lives of the women they purport to protect. <a href="https://www.kut.org/health/2024-06-26/texas-abortion-laws-post-roe-v-wade-dobbs-v-jackson-reversal">Paying informants to get information on providers who have performed an abortion</a> is unconscionable. This is closely akin to Communist and totalitarian regimes (not surprisingly) where the government will pay informants to reveal what their regimes regard as criminal. This is what we can reasonably expect from the religious right.</li>
<li>Changes in curriculum for grades K-5 are currently well underway. <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/05/30/texas-public-schools-religion-curriculum/">See this article from the Texas Tribune</a>. If you are a responsiblle parent, a Christian, and certainly if you are anybody else (any other reigion or identify as an agnostic or atheist), you should be very concerned. <em>I have also been reviewing</em> the Teacher&rsquo;s Guides for kindergarten and grades 1,2, and 5. If you don&rsquo;t want your second-grader to be studying The Great Awakening (a Christian revival movement), Sunday School material, the Sermon on the Mount, and other Christian views (many of them age-inappropriate), you should speak up to your Texas State Board of Education representatives and to your legislators. This is not just bad education. It is a breach of the <em>separation between Church and State.</em></li>

<li><a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/quality/new-york-system-puts-a-twist-on-root-cause-analysis.html">New York system puts a twist on root cause analysis</a> - (from Beckers Clinical Leadership newsletter) I&rsquo;ve written <a href="https://worldwidestew.com/blog/2024-09-01-dont-ask-why/">elsewhere</a> about the search for <em>Why</em> something happens. The formal name for this process is <em>root cause analysis</em> or RTC (not a real-time clock for your electronics geeks out there). All to often, the <em>Why</em> search ends up as an effort to find someone to blame. That&rsquo;s the dark side of <em>root cause analysis</em>. But, NYC Health + Hospitals has found a way to turn the RTC on it&rsquo;s head! Leaders there <em>are beginning to apply that same level of rigor when things go right.</em> Imagine. Rigorously looking for the processes and steps that make something work flawlessly! Now, that&rsquo;s positive step forward. Of note, if you&rsquo;re interested in this, search for the phrase <em>blameless post-mortems</em>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(24)00110-8/fulltext">Personal light exposure and incidence of Type 2 diabetes</a> - This was an enormous study. From the abstract: Background: <em>Whether personal light exposure predicts diabetes risk has not been demonstrated in a large prospective cohort.</em> Finding: <em>The difference in diabetes risk between people with bright and dark nights was similar to the difference between people with low and moderate genetic risk.</em> Interpretation: <em>Type 2 diabetes risk was higher in people exposed to brighter night light, and in people exposed to light patterns that may disrupt circadian rhythms. Avoidance of light at night could be a simple and cost-effective recommendation that mitigates risk of diabetes, even in those with high genetic risk.</em></li>

<li><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00070/full">Out-of-Body Experience: An fMRI Study</a>. - I&rsquo;m interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-body_experience">out-of-body experiences</a> the same way I&rsquo;m interested in UFOs and Bigfoot. The information ranges from utterly far-fetched to curious. This study was at the curious end of the spectrum. <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/07/05/1185868647/brain-out-of-body-experience">More recent research</a> suggests a particular area of the brain (the anterior precuneus) may be responsible for these experiences. One of my concerns with all these forms of research is the tendency to be reductionist: we want to break everything down into its component parts. We should resist the pressing human urge to identify and quantify everything.</li>
