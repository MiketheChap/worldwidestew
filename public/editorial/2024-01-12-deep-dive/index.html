    <p><a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/dsm-5-panel-members-received-14m-undisclosed-industry-2024a10000pa">DSM-5-TR Panel Members Received $14M in Undisclosed Industry Funding</a> - (Medscape) For those who donâ€™t know, the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) is the <em>Bible</em> for  psychology and psychiatry practitioners. Itâ€™s the basis for identifying mental illness and, consequently, billing for services. So, if you go for medication, therapy, or both, you must have a diagnosis. The diagnosis is taken from the DSM. Knowing this, itâ€™s easy to imagine why the psychology, psychiatry, pharmaceutical and insurance industries might have an interest in nudging diagnoses in particular directions. Clearly, overt <em>nudging</em> is unethical. As noted in this article, the American Psychiatric Association encourages transparent disclosures. But, do they do enough to prevent selection of panelists, promotion of certain perspectives, and disclosure of industry funding sources/amounts/types?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Investigators found that every DSM-5-TR panel included at least one member with industry ties. The panels with the highest number of members with a recent history of industry funding were those for neurodevelopmental disorders; bipolar disorders; obsessive-compulsive disorders; neurocognitive disorders; medication induced movement disorders; and disruptive, impulse control, and conduct disorders. More than 70% of members on those panels had received industry funding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Itâ€™s time for full disclosure. Organizations are made up of flawed humans subject to bias and mistaken values. Itâ€™s time for organizations and corporate structures to take steps to design for greater accountability, transparency, and ethical structural integrity checks/balances. I do hope youâ€™ll read this article.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/05/25/coffins-made-from-mushrooms-cost-availability/70255979007/">This Dutch startup company makes mushroom coffins that biodegrade in 45 days</a> - This is how I want to go after my [[notes/Death, dying, end of life|Death, dying, end of life]]. The Earth has finite resources. The usual burial practices are an enormous waste and burden on the environment. Up until now, I would have desired <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cremation">water cremation</a> if it were legal in Texas (given current  ridiculous crazy legal preferences). But, I now have a new burial process to which I aspire: a mushroom/hemp casket! Forty-five days and Mike is mostly gone! At last, via the mushroom/hemp casket, he will have done something good for the world! Seriously, this is a very positive trend in death care. I pray these innovative processes get rapid approval in the States. It will barely make a dent in the squandering of Earthâ€™s resources. But, in every way I can imagine, this is not only a carbon neutral way to care for the dead but a boon for rebuilding the planet in significant ways. Apparently, <em>no free refills</em>. &#x1f609;</p>

<p><a href="https://reference.medscape.com/viewarticle/996842">Rapid Review Quiz: Recent Evidence for Mindfulness</a> - As a Certified Workplace Mindfulness Facilitator by Mindful Leader, Iâ€™m a big proponent of many types of mindfulness processes, particularly mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR). Honestly, though, for multiple reasons the meditation research thatâ€™s been done - despite its increased prevalence in the past twenty or so years - is spotty. So, itâ€™s refreshing and instructive to test oneself and learn what recent, quality research has to say about mindfulness.</p>

<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/public-schools-and-faith-based-chaplains-texas-new-combination-is-testing-the-first-amendment-215132#:~:">Public schools andÂ faith-based chaplains: Texasâ€™ new combination is testing the FirstÂ Amendment</a> - I am a chaplain. Iâ€™ve spent most of my adult life as a chaplain. This new Texas law - as written - is bad and dangerous for our children. Right-wing religious zealots will do anything they can to make Texas into a dictatorial theocracy. While the religious right tries to ban <em>critical race theory</em> and engages in book-banning agendas to keep <em>our children safe</em>, they now suggest that we should allow unqualified <em>chaplains</em> to provide mental health treatment to our children? How is this reality-warping mindset even possible? Charles Russo writing in <a href="https://theconversation.com/public-schools-and-faith-based-chaplains-texas-new-combination-is-testing-the-first-amendment-215132#:~:"> The Conversation</a> writes</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB763/id/2686268">Senate Bill 763</a>, enacted in September 2023, allows school officials to hire unlicensed chaplains, either as staff members or volunteers. Those who can pass background checks will be allowed to perform duties typically provided by counselors, such as mental health support. Local boards have until March 1, 2024, to choose whether to allow chaplain programs in their schools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We should be very worried when society trusts any unqualified, untested religious advisors to be providing mental health care to our children. There is no accountability, no psychological training, and no verifiable religious training. The only requirement is passing a background check. With over thirty years as a chaplain in intense health care settings, Iâ€™m not qualified to provide mental health counseling to children.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m not against chaplains with verifiable qualifications working in educational settings and potentially providing mental health support. But, <em>apart from possessing separate, verifiable mental health training and practice</em>, chaplains have no place in counseling children in educational settings. Full ðŸ›‘. If you live in Texas, you should fight this in your schools. If you want to help childrenâ€™s psychological wellbeing, then budget to pay those who are demonstrably qualified. Otherwise, consider the long history of abuses occurring with children at the hands of religious leaders.</p>

<p>And, now for something positive! &#x1f604;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lionsroar.com/ubuntu-i-am-because-we-are/">Ubuntu: I Am Because We Are</a> - I use multiple computers in my home. The one I use the second most uses a Linux distribution called, <a href="%5Bhttps://ubuntu.com%5D(https://ubuntu.com/)">Ubuntu</a>. The referenced article says what Ubuntu means: <em>I am because we are</em>. I have to be very mindful of this idea during these disquieting days. There are many messages telling us that we are separate from one another and should be separate. Frankly, I donâ€™t like the promotion of separation agitation and hatred. Especially this year as we face a volatile election where combative words are the norm, we need a steady dose of <em>Ubuntu</em> going into the veins of America.</p>
