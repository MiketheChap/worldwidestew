    <h1>Deep Dive: emotional PPE; stressors and suicide; pain and mindfulness; kindness; COVID</h1>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve got a ton of open tabs on Safari and I&rsquo;m going to start saving them here once I figure out why they were important.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://emotionalppe.org/faq/">Emotional PPE</a> - this is a web site that provides links to free counseling resources for healthcare workers dealing with COVID sequelae.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/976717">Medscape - Overlapping Job Stressors May Flag Risk for Physician Suicide</a> - Wasn&rsquo;t there a game where you kept stacking something on the camel&rsquo;s back until it broke? Yeah. Like that. Administrative types are happy to assign another job and loath to remove them (except as a reminder that the person couldn&rsquo;t measure up): What could <em>possibly go wrong with that philosophy</em>?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889159122003336?via%3Dihub">The genomic impact of kindness to self vs. others: A randomized controlled trial</a> - *Prosocial engagement—doing something kind for others rather than oneself—reduces CTRA gene expression. The nature of kind acts and their intended recipient plays a key role in shaping the genomic impact of kindness.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://journals.lww.com/pain/Abstract/9900/Disentangling_self_from_pain__mindfulness.127.aspx">[Pain Mechanisms ]</a> - explores the neurological mechanisms between mindfulness meditation and [[Pain]] attenuation. <em>Thus, we propose that mindfulness meditation is associated with a novel self-referential nociceptive gating mechanism to reduce pain.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://sonjalyubomirsky.com/files/2022/07/Regan-Margolis-Ozer-Schwitzgebel-Lyubomirsky-in-press.pdf">What is Unique About Kindness? Exploring the Proximal Experience of Prosocial Acts Relative to Other Positive Behaviors</a> - very nice paper about [[kindness]] by colleagues and Sonja Lyubomirsky. *Multilevel models revealed that relative to all other conditions, participants assigned to do kind acts for others reported a greater sense of competence, self- confidence, and meaning while engaging in those acts across the intervention period. Engaging in acts of kindness for others also led to stronger feelings of connection relative to engaging in open-minded behavior or acts of kindness for oneself but did not differ from engaging in extraverted behavior. *</p>

Let&rsquo;s see&hellip; Yup. Health care workers are near the top of the list. Why? Exposure. And, unnecessary exposure, in some cases, because of selfishness.</p>
