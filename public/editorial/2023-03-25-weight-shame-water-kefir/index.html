    <h1>Deep Dive: Weight, self-criticism, and compassion-focused therapy</h1>
    
      <p class="author">By Mike Davis</p>
    
    <time>March 25, 2023</time>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re overweight, like me, you experience body-weight shame and are likely to be self-critical. Compassion-focused therapy seemed to help. In this study, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0005789423000163">Compassion Focused Therapy to Reduce Body Weight Shame for Individuals with Obesity: A Randomized Controlled Trial</a> the authors found that compassion-focused therapy (CFT). Their focus was on self-criticism. There appeared to be a meaningful reduction in self-criticism and weight-shame. However, from my read of the data, there were a couple of significant gaps in the study design: <em>The study used an RCT design with participants randomized to the CFT (n = 28) or waitlist control (n = 27) condition. Participants in both groups were assessed at pre- and post-intervention, with the <strong>CFT group alone</strong> assessed at three- and six-month follow-up intervention. Both self-report and a physiological measure of parasympathetic nervous system activity were used (i.e., heart rate variability). Results indicated that CFT had a significant positive impact at post-intervention compared to the control group for body weight shame (internal &amp; external), increasing self-compassion, reducing fears of compassion (self, other, and receiving), reducing self-criticism, and reducing external shame. <strong>Although there were no significant group effects at post-intervention on depression and anxiety, 66% of participants had clinical improvement on depression in the CFT group compared to 8% in the control group at post-intervention</strong>.</em> My question is this: would this alone  a compelling reason for me to engage in such a practice? I don&rsquo;t think so. But, it&rsquo;s interesting. Tie these results to weight loss and you have a cottage industry.</p>
<p>This week I&rsquo;ve been making <a href="https://poseymom.com/pages/water-kefir-instructions">Kefir Water</a> a cultured beverage sharing characteristics with Milk Kefir and Kombucha. You mix kefir grains with water, sugar, and a mineral of some sort. I used molasses. I find the taste of Kombucha too acidic, too vinegary. All these beverages provide healthy benefits to the gut (and perhaps the gut-brain axis). Or, at least that&rsquo;s the claim. I&rsquo;m <em>not making that claim</em> but certainly other fermented substances like sauerkraut are very healthy. Anyway, my first batch is now done. It&rsquo;s sweetish and tastes, to quote my sisters, <em>like pool water that&rsquo;s clean and slightly sweet.</em> I think that&rsquo;s not a ringing endorsement. But, it was cheap to make a batch and interesting, if only as a science experiment.</p>
