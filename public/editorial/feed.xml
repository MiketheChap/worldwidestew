      <title>Deep Dive: Suicide Crisis Syndrome</title>
      <link>https://worldwidestew.com/editorial/2024-05-19-deep-dive/</link>

      <description>There are many methods of screening for suicide risk. The idea of the Suicide Crisis Syndrome appeals to me. It argues that depression or anxiety don&amp;rsquo;t explain all suicide experiences.</description>

      <description>This week’s featured articles
From Harvard Business Review. Do you have a phone addiction? - uhh, probably. Now, do something about it. What happens when hospitals aren’t appropriately funded? They often turn to funding from Private Equity firms. What happens then? It’s not good and costs patients and society. Read this article from Harvard. </description>

      <title>Deep Dive: A questionable iOS feature; US Disease Burden from plastics; interesting recent articles</title>
      <link>https://worldwidestew.com/editorial/2024-01-28-deep-dive/</link>

      <description>A review of news I find interesting. 1. An iOS &lt;em&gt;feature&lt;/em&gt; you might want to fix. 2. It&amp;rsquo;s taken a long time for plastics to create what many believe will create significant human disease burden. That ship has gathered substantial steam. 3. Possiblle harms related to mindfulness (if your going to be in a mindfulness group, make sure the leader is qualified). 4. Watch out for marketing using &lt;em&gt;neuro&lt;/em&gt;: they may be trying to get into your head. 5. A compassion therapy that can boost &lt;em&gt;expansiveness&lt;/em&gt;? That just blows my mind (if it turns out to be good research).</description>

      <title>Deep Dive: Apple notifications and the Religious Right</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve liked my iPhone. Except for notifications. Google did them much better. But, that&amp;rsquo;s just an annoyance. The Religious Right and it&amp;rsquo;s efforts to create a love child with our political leaders is downright scary. We should be very scared. All of us. Even the good people who subscribe.</description>

      <description>Shame drives us to great self-harm. Media is shame&amp;rsquo;s sledge hammer. Also, pay attention to the sense of smell!</description>

      <description>This week we look at psychological well-being - including from the U.S. Surgeon General, paying attention to the experience of detransitioners, exposomics, silence and epigenetics, Buddhism (religion or not), and my bone to pick with the &lt;em&gt;Humanist Chaplaincy Network&lt;/em&gt; (I&amp;rsquo;m not picking any bones with humanist chaplains).</description>

      <description>This week we consider recent research on mindfulness showing distinct patterns of contemplative practive help well-being. We also look at an article on the death experience during CPR. Maybe we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t blow off those near-death experiences so quickly.</description>
