    <h1>Deep Dive: The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</h1>
    
      <p class="author">By Mike Davis</p>
    
    <time>February 17, 2023</time>
    <p><a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/adamgrant/p/mbti-if-you-want-me-back-you-need">What&rsquo;s so wrong with the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)</a>- Like Organizational Psychologist Adam Grant, the first time I met the MBTI, I wondered <em>Where&rsquo;d they get the crystal ball?</em> I took it while training to be a chaplain. It definitely felt like someone was reading my mail.</p>
<p>But, there were niggling questions after taking the MBTI. <em>That&rsquo;s not me. Not all the time. When I get doen with my training, would I really want an employer using this to screen me for employment or determine how I would fit in with the team better?</em> Also, as science began to matter more, it became clear that data supporting the MBTI assumptions were non-existent. It was based on Jungian psychology (which, though I appreciate, is not something on which to base  scientific personality types). Among the additional reasons does questioning the scientific basis for these types of tests, here are others: The reliability of self-report surveys (in fairness, sometimes there are no options), the malleability of personality (especially in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001879115300191?via%3Dihub">particular settings</a>). These changes occur regardless of the <em>assessment you use</em>: they reflect your response to work circumstances. Presumably, similar changes can occur in other environments.</p>
<p>What are the alternatives that <em>have scientific merit</em>? The Big Five. You can take Big Five Assessments <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/personality-quiz/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.hoganassessments.com/assessment/hogan-personality-inventory/">here</a>, and <a href="https://principlesyou.com/">here</a>. Recent research suggests there are Six categories of personality and it uses a broader scientific approach to update the Big Five (you won&rsquo;t see <em>any updates to the MBTI</em>). This newest version of the Big Five is called the HEXACO and you can take it <a href="https://hexaco.org/">here</a>.</p>
<p>My point here is that the MBTI (and let&rsquo;s go ahead and throw the Enneagram in with it) are cute but not scientific. They should never be used for hiring decisions and shouldn&rsquo;t be used to inform self-understanding. If you want to explore your temporary personality characteristics, use something based on science like the tools mentioned in the prior paragraph.</p>
