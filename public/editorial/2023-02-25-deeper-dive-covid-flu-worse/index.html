    <h1>Deep Dive for 2024-02-25: Was COVID worse than the flu? </h1>
    
      <p class="author">By Mike Davis</p>
    
    <time>February 25, 2023</time>
    <p>When I was doing research studies, a friend of mine - a brilliant researcher - endlessly reminded me that it was wrong to guess what the data would say. *Mike, you can&rsquo;t say that yet! YOu don&rsquo;t have the data! Even if you think you know what the data will say, you can&rsquo;t make that conclusion until you have the data.</p>
<p>Often, during the pandemic, we heard people who should have known better telling us <em>what the data would say</em>. <em>This is no worse than the flu.</em> They had no idea what they were talking about. So, I&rsquo;ve revised this article slightly since it&rsquo;s original pulblication. It now reflects more of my frustration with those who drew conclusions when conclusions shouldn&rsquo;t have been drawn.</p>
<ul>
<li>Which is more deadly? COVID-19 or the flu? - <a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/988548">Per Medscape</a> COVID-19, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2801464">of course</a>. The second link goes to the original article. Who cares? Probably, very few. However, the article does speak to the promise that COVID-19 was no worse than getting the flu. It was, in fact, worse than the flu.</li>
</ul>
