      <description>I think I was unfailingly gentle with patients, let them rant, and tolerated their abuses. Eventually, their rant lost steam and we started to get to the core of their often legitimate frustrations. They might be directed at an unrealized hope for a dreamed of healing. Or, they might feel they weren&amp;rsquo;t understood. A pinhole in a balloon release pressurized air madly at first out of a pricked balloon. Then, the balloon eventually loses pressure and falls to the floor.</description>

      <description>About my use of AI:
❌ I usually use AI to improve my writing process: to check spelling, accuracy, flow, grammar, and tone. 🧐 Even where other sources are quoted, I cross-check with Claude.ai and other secondary sources for validation. 💡 My writing process usually involves finding something inspiring, interesting, coincidental, absurd, or odd. Then, I work collaboratively with my preferred AI, Claude.ai. Why? My fingers don&amp;rsquo;t work like they did.</description>

      <description>I beg you tp keep reading for just a minute.
This coming week NASA plans to send three projects into space. One of them is the Carruthers Geocorona Observatory. This mission wants to better understand our outer atmosphere. This knowledge will help us understand changes that occur in the area just before we get to &amp;ldquo;outer space.&amp;rdquo; Scientists call this the geocorona. Scientists love big words. And, Of course, they need a very specific definition they all know and understand.</description>

      <title>Never waste an elevator trip</title>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a reason they ask entrepreneurs, what is your elevator speech?
It&amp;rsquo;s because a lot can happen in an elevator. Two or more people meet. There are limmited distractions. You have an opportunity to share messages. You might make a transaction.
Anyway, that&amp;rsquo;s the logic of it.
Like most things, there&amp;rsquo;s more than logic in promoting the elevator speech.
You&amp;rsquo;re making a mad dash to decent coffee. Your hair may or may not be combed.</description>

      <title>On Independence, wealth, and status</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Indepenence Day in the United States. As a nation, the United States seems less independent than at any time in our history.
In this post, I wanted to talk about how a country&amp;rsquo;s economic policies promote or removes freedoms. This post starts with a policy that swept America away: Trickle-down Economics. Trickle-down economics came into public discussion during the United States Presidency of Ronald Reagan. It promised that great wealth trickles down to the poor.</description>

      <description>I suspect my Mom wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only parent who responded to her children&amp;rsquo;s loud disagreements and fighting by telling us to go to our rooms.
It was good advice. When we get caught up in fight (part of the fight, flight, faint network), the chemicals coursing through our bodies want to defend ourselves from fear of shame, embarrassment, and , occasionally, physical injury.
Often, the most mindful way of navigating our fear, anger, and doubt is to separate ourselves from the circumstances.</description>

      <description>Pastor Martin Niemöller did what many Christians did when they saw the Third Reich systematically remove the rights of selected populations. Group by group, Hitler and his hinchmen took away the rights 1) of the press, 2) of educational institutions and their professors, 3) of races, 4) the mentally ill, 5) of dissidents, and of other groups.
Like all good religious people, he said nothing.
Then they came for him.</description>

      <description>When I started Worldwide Stew, I intended the Blog area of the site to be generally positive in tone. I would reserve the Opinion area of the site for news and opinions about science, health, politics, and fun stuff.
And then we ended up with what can only be called a fascist Administration(Merriam-Webster definition at the link). At this point, the scaffolding that held up any form of democracy is quickly eroding, like hurricane-force winds along the shoreline.</description>

      <description>If you live in the United States and can read this text, it&amp;rsquo;s possible that you learned some reading on Sesame Street. As you got older, you might have watched an episode of the science program Nova. As an adult, you may have watched news programming on the Evening News Hour. While it is fair to say that PBS coverage does tend to lean left of center; unlike other network news, however, PBS makes a concerted effort to fairly cover multiple sides of the issues.</description>

      <title>Beliefs Worth Examining</title>
      <link>https://worldwidestew.com/blog/2025-05-10-beliefs-worth-examining/</link>

      <description>What would your belief system - your religion and politics, for example - have to do to cause you to reject it? It&amp;rsquo;s a question for our ideology-driven times.
Decades ago I believed in almost every facet of the Christian Nationalist dream, including their beliefs about sexuality. I ignored the human experience, following ideology instead. Then, as a chaplain in training, I sat by a gay man who lost his partner moments before.</description>

      <title>The Obligations of Witnessing</title>

      <description>Many years ago, I worked in a little religious school. One of the children could barely speak. She had many siblings. She came to school with bruises. One day she accidentally fell out of the car. I told the principal that we should report the situation. I was told that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t our business and that reporting them to government authorities wasn&amp;rsquo;t right. I still anonymously reported them. My employment ended soon thereafter.</description>

      <description>Satisfaction guaranteed or your money back.
When someone says, Satisfaction guaranteed or your money back they are upping the value of their promise. They are saying, You have nothing to lose.
But, even if you are able to get your money back, you&amp;rsquo;ve still lost something: time and trust. Broken trust steadily erodes our lives and connections. The return of our money can&amp;rsquo;t return the time and hope for a resolution to our problem.</description>

      <title>Finding Wisdom Beyond Desperation</title>
      <link>https://worldwidestew.com/blog/2025-02-25-finding-wisdom-beyond-desperation/</link>

      <description>When we lead from wisdom, we must first recognize when desire transforms into craving.
My vision for creating meaningful mindfulness opportunities keeps me motivated, but I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed how easily genuine passion can transform into an anxious urgency—a shift that rarely allows for clear discernment or thoughtful decision-making.
Operating from desperation narrows our vision. It tempts us toward shortcuts, clouds our understanding, and blinds us to others&amp;rsquo; authentic motives and needs.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I haven&amp;rsquo;t in the 23 years that I have been in the uniformed services of the USA ever violated an order, not one.&amp;rdquo; - Oliver North, Iran-Contra Affair testimony.
I grew up in a military family. Yes, Sir. No, Sir. You were supposed to follow orders. Not the orders you chose, but all orders. Perhaps Oliver North - who chose to follow all orders - wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have ended up testifying before Cngress in the Iran-Contra Scandal if he had chosen to disobey illegal orders.</description>

&lt;p&gt;With this post I hope to do two things. I want to write about home. And Toads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was on a quest to find a happy quotation to seal into a home being built by a friend. &lt;em&gt;Do you have a good blessing, verse, or prayer?&lt;/em&gt;  Where should I go but my favorite AI, &lt;a href=&#34;https://claude.ai&#34;&gt;Claude.ai&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;🚀  ANNOUNCING three new &amp;ldquo;AI for the Rest of Us&amp;rdquo;: Hands-On Workshops: August 2, 9, and 23, 2025. The cost is $50.00. Limited scholarships are available based on the number of fully paid enrollments.&lt;/p&gt;
