      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Ash Wednesday. I feel a little sad about that. Why? When I think of Ash Wednesday, here&amp;rsquo;s the thing I remember most.
I was a chaplain at Baylor Scott &amp;amp; White Heart and Vascular Hospital in Dallas. Even though I wasn&amp;rsquo;t Catholic, each Ash Wednesday I was deputized to impose Ashes on the foreheads of anyone who wanted them. I received Ashes and then was deputized to impose them on others.</description>

      <description>The Saturday Night Monster Late on Saturday nights, the most frightening monster of all enters our home. It drags me to the fridge, seizing my hands and coercing them into into the freezer section. Resistance, as they say, is futile. Before I know it, I&amp;rsquo;ve succumbed to it&amp;rsquo;s cruel overtures.
If I were more mindful about the Saturday Night Monster,

      <description>I was passing through the living room. An advertisement was on the television. I feel a special contempt for these kinds of ads. A woman had used some kind of special formula.&amp;quot; As a result os using the preparation she said, I was beautiful.&amp;quot;
No, dear lady. To the extent you&amp;rsquo;re beautiful, it comes from the inside.
In the many years I cared for very sick people, I saw many of them when they regarded themselves as ugly.</description>
