      <description>My phone&amp;rsquo;s keyboard consistently turns &amp;ldquo;and&amp;rdquo; into &amp;ldquo;abs&amp;rdquo; when I swipe-type, an algorithm error that happens dozens of times weekly. Despite how frequently I use &amp;ldquo;and&amp;rdquo; versus how rarely anyone types &amp;ldquo;abs,&amp;rdquo; the code refuses to learn my patterns.
We operate on similar faulty algorithms. When our partner raises a concern, our mental predictive text instantly jumps to defensiveness, hearing criticism when they&amp;rsquo;re offering connection. Like my stubborn keyboard, we&amp;rsquo;ve been programmed by past experiences to misinterpret what&amp;rsquo;s actually being said.</description>
