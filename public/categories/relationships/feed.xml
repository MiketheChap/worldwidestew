      <description>Many years ago, I worked in a little religious school. One of the children could barely speak. She had many siblings. She came to school with bruises. One day she accidentally fell out of the car. I told the principal that we should report the situation. I was told that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t our business and that reporting them to government authorities wasn&amp;rsquo;t right. I still anonymously reported them. My employment ended soon thereafter.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If canines and apes can cooperate, why can&amp;rsquo;t humans?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The excellent documentary, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32907397/&#34;&gt;Inside the Mind of a Dog&lt;/a&gt; on Netflix makes the case that dogs relate to humans because they are creatures that value cooperation. In fact, this was a surprising evolutionary development. The dogs we have come to know, value, and love, have done so as a result of their desire to cooperate. They long for connection and cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
