I was passing through the living room. An advertisement was on the television. I feel a special contempt for these kinds of ads. A woman had used some kind of special *formula." After she used the *preparation*, she said, I *was* beautiful."

No, dear lady. To the extent you're beautiful, it comes from the inside. 

In the many years I cared for very sick people, I saw many of them when they regarded themselves as ugly. 

The good days on the job were during visits when I got to see the corners of their mouths reveal a slight smile. 

>You have a such beautiful smile. Whatever you are going through, try to find the place where that smile lives. Hold on to it if you can. It's lovely to see.

No formula can impart what I saw on those faces. All races. All affiliations. All genders. All ages. I see them now. Sooo beautiful.
