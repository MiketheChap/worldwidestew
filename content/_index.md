### Worldwide Stew is being refurbished. 
#### It will take about two months to get all the old site content back. Thank you for your patience!

Cook it long and slow. Allow all the flavors to meld. Serve only when it’s ready. That’s the goal here. 
  
Some restaurants slam meals together using a few cheap spices bought in bulk long-past their expiration date; pre-mixed sauces; and pre-cooked items. There's lots of sodium to give the illusion of flavor. In short, most restaurants create processed foods.  

Who is Mike? Chaplain specializing in cardiovascular and end-of-life care. I also have experience in clinical research study design, preparation, data gathering, and reporting. I’m also a Certified Workplace Mindfulness Facilitator (CWMF) through Mindful Leader. I’ve been leading mindfulness sessions for two years priori to my retirement in December 2023. I’ve started doing mindfulness sessions again via Zoom with interested individuals in my new life chapter ([learn more here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XJMAs5ieSmFgZZuNpkF1bLkwrdDSpboPMKREmXJ_pLo/edit), [sign up here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LQP2uy1-w8zzHE5_5QTA6kAWFSxcvK2LzB0zxaurpOk/viewform?edit_requested=true)). I’m currently working on a Positive Psychology Certification from U Penn. 

Mostly, I’m interested in helping relieve suffering and marshaling the human spirit and consciousness to help with that. I’m a lifelong learner. Unlike many of my learning efforts in the past, I’m no longer trying so hard to learn what the Gatekeepers tell me to: I’m learning what I want to learn. If I can help you, please let me know. 

My effort here will be brevity (admittedly quite an exercise for the author), consideration, reflection, and, perhaps, greater insight through the passing of time: *How does the stew actually taste?*  You and I are the judges of success. I'm ninety-nine percent certain I will miss the mark for both of us. Part of my failures will be related to  expression of unformed (or worse, idiotic) ideas, biases, poor research, and lack of knowledge (think [the Dunning-Kruger Effect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780123855220000056?via%3Dihub)). 

I will revisit, edit, amend, and change my posts and my life. Most thoughts here aren’t fully formed and certainly not ready for publication (I probably changed my mind shortly after putting it online!). They are my effort to keep creating and to *practice* writing. 
  
I'll  write about whatever suits me and - hopefully, perhaps - you: inspiration, a modicum of politics, religion (more likely spirituality), cooking, events in general, some science, and some management crap. 

I've tried to organize the site into big menu categories. These are important:
1. Blog - Here, I focus on inspiration, life qualities, positive psychology, and personal growth. I'll generally avoid politics here, though not always. 
2. About - This is stuff about me. If you hate home movies, you probably won't like this much, either. Still, there's the smallest of chances there will be something here to interest you. If not, get over it. 
3. Events - I'm leading meditation sessions and will be teaching classes.
4. Media - things I've recorded you might be interested in. Some might be meaningful, some silly, some meditation sessions I've recorded and links to others.
5. Deeper Dive - In this area I share recent research psychology articles I've read, political and ethics perspectives, opinions, and even recipes. 
  
We first posted on our Blogger account on September 26, 2008. I didn't put much there. The same may happen here. However, it seems like my goal of a daily writing practice is closer. 

Much of what you read here grew out of notes taken for years on Obsidian. I was using Obsidian to keep all my information and to publish my blog. I wasn't able to do some things I wanted to so I studied hard to learn how to develop sites using Hugo and JAMstack frameworks. I hope it looks good! Still, I can't recommend [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) enough. It does much, much more than publish websites. You should at least download and try Obsidian to save notes! can also achieve one more goal: privacy.
