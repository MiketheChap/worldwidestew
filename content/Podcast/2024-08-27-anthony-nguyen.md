In this episode, I interview a friend and colleague, Anthony Nguyen, an Rn with a BSN from Midwestern State University. He's worked for Baylor University Medical Center and now Baylor Scott & White Heart and Vascular Hospital in downtown Dallas. 

We talked about the following:
1. The rich meaning of travel (twice, in fact), 
2. Ethics (especially with respect to the work of Jane Tronto),
3. Culture differences, 
4. Generational differences, 
5. Healthcare, 
6. A recent study stating that ~ 60% of nurses would not include a chaplain on a consult for acute pain 
7. And the role and needs of nurses.
