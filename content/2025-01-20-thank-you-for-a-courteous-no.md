Thank you for a courteous No.

Were recently visited the Disney District at Anaheim. We'd been told that we could take our dog inside that area. As we walked toward the entry, a Security Guard approached us. He addressed us kindly and with a smile. No *power dynamics on display.* 

>*Do you mind if I ask you you follks a couple of questions? I'd like to save you a few steps if I can.* 

He asked the service dog qualification questions to see if Cassie was a qualified service dog under federal law.

As it turned out, dogs are not allowed in the Disney District unless they are service dogs. The security guard did save us steps. 

The security guard framed things in a way where: 
1. Nothing was harsh or adversarial. To the contrary, he was friendly, kind and respectful. *You'all seem like smart folks and you clearly know the rules about service dogs. So, it's just something to think about.* 
2. He was helping us *save a few steps*. 
3. He didn't issue a *Hard No*. Instead, he said, *You'all look pretty smart so I'll just leave it with you*. The implication was that the *Hard No* was probably coming if we kept going or if we lied. 
4. He *prepared* us for what to expect if we continued. 

Modern society is constantly on *fight or flight* mode. We are always playing *zero-sum* games where there are *only* winners and losers. 

*Why must things be this way?*

It is possible to - even in the presence of polarized policies, rules, and barriers - to act with restraint, kindness, respect, and understanding. We can all bend. We all think we're defending some great principle. \

Save your energy for the real principle. Until then, settle in with your dog next to you in the car, outside Anaheim's Disney District and read a food book. In our *continual fight-or-flight state, we're burning up way too much energy on things that really don't matter.*
