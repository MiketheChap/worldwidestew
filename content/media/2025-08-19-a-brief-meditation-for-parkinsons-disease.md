#### This is a transcript of my Self-Acceptance Meditation 

This meditation is a collaboration with [Claude.ai](https:claude.ai). 

Hi, this is Mike Davis. I am the host of the Worldwide Stew podcast and [WorldwideStew.com](https://worldwidestew.com). This is a focused effort to try to provide some hopefully helpful meditation, brief ones, for those with Parkinson's disease. I hope this helps. Thanks for listening. So I want to welcome you to this gentle meditation for self-acceptance. However you arrived here today, at this moment, sitting, lying down, in a wheelchair, you've made it to this moment and that takes incredible courage. 

So there's no need to change anything about your position or your body right now. We're simply going to spend a few moments together honoring who you are in this moment. And so take a gentle breath if you can or simply allow your breathing to be natural and easy, beginning by noticing what it feels like to be supported.  

In this moment, feel the surface beneath you, your bed, your chair, whatever's holding you. This support has been there for you. Steady and reliable. It's here right now. 

Notice the weight of your body as it rests here. holds your body as it rests here. There's no effort required, no performance needed. Your body is simply being held. 

If thoughts about what you used to be able to do arise, that's perfectly natural. Acknowledge them gently. like greeting someone that you've known in days gone by. 

Then let them pass by like clouds in the sky. 

Now we'll take a kind journey through your body. Not to judge or fix anything, but simply to offer gentle acknowledgement. 

Starting with your head. Well, your head has held so many memories, so much wisdom, so much wisdom, so much energy. Nice. Life experience. Thank it for all it has experienced, all it has learned. If there are tremors or stiffness, breathe softness towards these areas. 

Move your attention to your shoulders and arms. These arms have embraced loved ones, have created, have worked. Even if they move differently now, they still carry the essence of all that caring. All that creating. All that loving. 

All that loving. Notice your chest. The space around your heart. And with each breath, however shallow or deep, your heart continues its faithful rhythm. And with each breath, however shallow or deep, your heart continues its faithful rhythm. This heart has loved so deeply, has felt joy, and has weathered storms. It continues to beat for you, even now, steady and true. 

Bring awareness to your core. This is your belly. This is your body. This is your body. This is your body. This is your body. And with each breath, however shallow or deep, your heart continues its faithful rhythm. This heart has loved so deeply, has felt joy, and has weathered storms. It continues to beat for you, even now, steady and true. 

Bring awareness to your core, your belly. This is your center, your place of strength. Even when movement feels difficult, this center holds your life force, your spirit that no illness can diminish. 

Feel your hips and legs. Notice them. These legs have carried you through life's journeys, literal and metaphorical. 

You called on them at difficult times, 

and they got you where you needed to go. They may need different support now, but they remain part of your wholeness and part of your lifelong story. 

And now, with your whole being, let these words settle into your heart. 

I am worthy of love and respect, exactly as I am right now. 

My value as a person is not determined by what my body can or cannot do. I 

have weathered many storms in my life, and I continue to be resilient and to find ways to keep going. 

There is a light within me that shines, regardless of my physical condition. 

I am more than this illness. I am spirit. I am love. I am enough. 

Those who love me see my whole self, my heart, my essence, my irreplaceable presence in their lives. 

People who love me often call me to mind with gentleness. It is safe to rest. It is safe to receive care. It is safe to be exactly who I am today.

And, by resting, I bring a sense of care and confidence to those who care for me. 

Let my rest be gentle. 

So, take a moment to imagine yourself surrounded by a warm, golden light. 

And this light that you're imagining represents all the love that has ever been directed toward you. From family and friends, pets, even strangers, who have shown you kindness. 

This light doesn't depend on your abilities or accomplishments. It exists simply because you exist. Let this light surround you like a gentle embrace. 

And as we close, know that this sense of acceptance, this feeling of being enough travels with you. Beyond the opening and closing of this meditation, it can be here with you five minutes from now. It can be with you tomorrow. It's always available to you. No matter what your body is experiencing, hold yourself in this. Hold yourself in this light. You are loved. You are valued. You are complete just as you are. 

And when you're ready, take one more gentle breath and allow yourself to simply rest in this truth. 

Thank you.
