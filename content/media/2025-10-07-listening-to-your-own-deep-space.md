We just added a new podcast epissode, Listening to Your Own Deep Space. This episode is [available on Apple podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/listening-to-your-own-deep-space/id1765332412?i=1000730448543).

If you prefer to read my blog post that came out before the podcast, you can check it out [here](https://worldwidestew.com/blog/2025-09-05-listening-to-your-own-deep-space/). 

I like taking quizzes to see what I've learned. If you enjoy taking easy quizzes (which can also do something for your self-esteem), the blog post or listening to the podcast episode, check out what you learned [here](https://forms.gle/FukYQvUCKW9fwADr7). 

*Here's the summary:*

Listen to a chirp from deep spaceâ€”two black holes colliding over a billion years ago. It took decades of planning and listening for LIGO's scientists to detect that signal. What if you could build your own LIGO for detecting the quiet signals within you? This episode explores how gravitational wave detection teaches us to listen to our ego awareness with curiosity instead of judgment.

I hope you enjoy this episode. It's slightly over 18 minutes long.
