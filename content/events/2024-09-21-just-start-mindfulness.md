🕯️ 🍃 Sign up for *free* Positively Mindful Meet-Ups. I'm hosting two sessions this Fall. 
- Thursday mornings from 10-10:45 am (CT). I'd love to meet you and make a connection. The sessions are intended to be comfortable for anyone without regard to religion or political persuasion. You don't have to speak if you don't want. The focus is on staying positive, though not naive. If you want to sign up please complete [this form](https://forms.gle/29TnAF3PLrosZktU6). The group size is limited to fifteen people.
