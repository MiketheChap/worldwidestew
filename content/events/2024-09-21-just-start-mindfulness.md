#### Join us for Mindfulness Group Sessions January-March 2025
Thank you for visiting *Worldwide Stew's Mindfulness Meditations page*. 

From January 23-March 27, 2025, I hope to offer two sessions each week. There is no charge. One will be on Thursday mornings from 10 to 10:45 a.m. If people register for the evening session, I'll also do Thursday evening sessions from 7:30 to 8:15 p.m. If you want to sign up for these sessions, please complete [this form](https://forms.gle/UvJnRzBrt7s4b2pP9). If we don't have more than five people register for the evening session, I'll cancel it.

I look forward to building a simple, connected community of learning.
