üïØÔ∏è üçÉ Sign up for *free* Positively Mindful Meet-ups. I host these sessions on Thursday mornings from 10-10:45 am (CT). I'd love to meet you and make a connection. The sessions are intended to be comfortable for anyone without regard to religion or political persuasion. They focus on staying positive, but not naive.
