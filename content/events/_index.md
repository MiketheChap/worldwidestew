#### Join us for Mindfulness Group Sessions January-March 2025

From January 23-March 27, 2025, I hope to offer two sessions each week. There is no charge. One will be on Thursday mornings from 10 to 10:45 a.m. If people register for the evening session, I'll also do Thursday evening sessions from 7:30 to 8:15 p.m. If you want to sign up for these sessions, please complete [this form](https://forms.gle/UvJnRzBrt7s4b2pP9). If we don't have more than five people register for the evening session, I'll cancel it.

**Book Reviews** - In the next few months, I plan to host a book review with a friend and colleague, Andres. My thought is to host an online discussion with a guest while having participants join us on this website's Discord. If you wish to get started, here's the first book we'll discuss: [Seven Brief Lessons on Physics by Carlo Rovelli](https://bookshop.org/p/books/seven-brief-lessons-on-physics-carlo-rovelli/10216888?ean=9780399184413). It's available in hardback and audio versions. It may possible to borrow it from your local library using library apps like Libby or Hoopla. You may also be able to borrow it for free from the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/seven-brief-lessons-on-physics-by-rovelli-carlo). *Before you ask: No you don't need to know anything about math or physics to enjoy or understand this book.* I chose this based on my discussions with people who have read it and other reviews.
