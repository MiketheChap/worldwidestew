ðŸš€ REGISTRATION for the **May session has closed***. New sessions will coming in July and August 2025. I'll announce the dates soon. 


ðŸš€  ANNOUNCING TWO SESSIONS: "AI for the Rest of Us" - A Hands-On Workshop

"AI for the Rest of Us" - It's Not Just About Work Tasks

I've been reflecting on what makes our upcoming AI workshop truly special, and I wanted to share more about the journey we'll take together...
This isn't just another "productivity hack" class. We're going beyond *working smarter* to explore how AI can enhance your creative endeavors and personal growth.
In our workshop, you'll:
âœ¨ Master the "Magic Prompt Conversation Flow" - a technique that breaks you out of limited thinking about what AI "should" be doing
âœ¨ Progress from giving basic commands to engaging in true collaborative exchanges
âœ¨ Participate in guided "Knowledge Expeditions" where you and AI explore topics you're curious about.
âœ¨ Experience group "Idea Volleys" where we collectively build on each other's creative concepts
âœ¨ Discover how to shift perspectives and see problems through new lenses

The beauty of learning in a group setting is witnessing how others approach the same tools in completely different ways. One person might use AI to design a garden, while another explores family recipes, and someone else crafts a children's story. Whatever sparks your curiosity - creative writing, learning new subjects, exploring ideas, or yes, even work projects - you'll gain approaches that transform how you interact with AI.
I'm capping this workshop at 20 people to ensure our collaborative environment thrives. A few spots have been claimed, with room for more curious minds!
ðŸ“… July and August dates will be announced here soon. They are held via Zoom ðŸ‘‰ More information [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i-3pxdfAy_3vTgBbldmEo-GXvK2rP7Z3/view?usp=sharing)
