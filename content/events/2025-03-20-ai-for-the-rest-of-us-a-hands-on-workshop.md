ðŸš€  ANNOUNCING three new "AI for the Rest of Us": Hands-On Workshops: August 2, 9, and 16, 2025. 

I've been reflecting on what makes our upcoming AI workshop truly special. I wanted to share more about the journey we'll take together...

This isn't just another "productivity hack" class. We're going beyond *working smarter* to exploring how AI can enhance your creative endeavors and personal growth.

<!--more-->
In our workshop, you'll:
âœ¨ Master the "Magic Prompt Conversation Flow" - a technique that transforms our limited thinking about what AI "should" be
âœ¨ Progress from giving basic commands to engaging in true collaborative exchanges
âœ¨ Participate in guided "Knowledge Expeditions" where you and AI explore topics you're curious about.
âœ¨ Experience group "Idea Volleys" where we collectively build on each other's creative concepts
âœ¨ Discover how to shift perspectives and see problems through new lenses
âœ¨ Learn how to use AI mindfully from someone who's spent time learning mindfulness. 

Why do this in a workshop? Well, it's just more fun! The beauty of learning in a group setting is witnessing how others approach the same tools in completely different ways. One person uses AI to design a garden, while another explores family recipes, and someone else crafts a children's story. Whatever scratches your itches, AI has something to offer.
I'm capping this workshop at 15 people to ensure our collaborative environment thrives.
ðŸ“… July and August dates will be announced here soon. They are held via Zoom ðŸ‘‰ More information [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i-3pxdfAy_3vTgBbldmEo-GXvK2rP7Z3/view?usp=sharing)
