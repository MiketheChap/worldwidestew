üöÄ ANNOUNCING: "AI for the Rest of Us" - A Hands-On Workshop (BETA)

Tired of theoretical AI classes? Join me for a practical, interactive workshop focused on using AI tools in your daily life and work!

What makes this workshop different:
- Learn by doing, not just listening
- Work on real projects that matter to YOU
- Small-group practice sessions in a supportive environment
- Focus on immediate, practical applications
- No technical background required
- "Show and Tell" your AI homework successes!

This workshop ‚Äì a preview edition of a future multi-session class - is designed for regular people who want practical results - whether you're looking to streamline work, boost creativity, or just understand how to use these powerful tools effectively. AI has been part of my daily workflow for well over a year now. I use it to plan trips, to find recipes for forgotten dishes, to help with my writing, and to explore ideas about living life better. And, AI is helping me to prepare for our time together every step of the way! I was sharing my sense of Imposter Syndrome a few minutes ago and it told me: Trust your experience and remember that your participants are there because they want the approachable, practical perspective you're offering. You've got this! Maybe you need this kind of help?

üìÖ Starting March 29 at 10:00 a.m. CT via Zoom
‚ö†Ô∏è Limited to 20 participants to ensure personal attention
