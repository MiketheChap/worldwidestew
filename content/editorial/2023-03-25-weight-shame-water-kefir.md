If you're overweight, like me, you experience body-weight shame and are likely to be self-critical. Compassion-focused therapy seemed to help. In this study, [Compassion Focused Therapy to Reduce Body Weight Shame for Individuals with Obesity: A Randomized Controlled Trial](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0005789423000163) the authors found that compassion-focused therapy (CFT). Their focus was on self-criticism. There appeared to be a meaningful reduction in self-criticism and weight-shame. However, from my read of the data, there were a couple of significant gaps in the study design: *The study used an RCT design with participants randomized to the CFT (n = 28) or waitlist control (n = 27) condition. Participants in both groups were assessed at pre- and post-intervention, with the **CFT group alone** assessed at three- and six-month follow-up intervention. Both self-report and a physiological measure of parasympathetic nervous system activity were used (i.e., heart rate variability). Results indicated that CFT had a significant positive impact at post-intervention compared to the control group for body weight shame (internal & external), increasing self-compassion, reducing fears of compassion (self, other, and receiving), reducing self-criticism, and reducing external shame. **Although there were no significant group effects at post-intervention on depression and anxiety, 66% of participants had clinical improvement on depression in the CFT group compared to 8% in the control group at post-intervention**.* My question is this: would this alone  a compelling reason for me to engage in such a practice? I don't think so. But, it's interesting. Tie these results to weight loss and you have a cottage industry. 

This week I've been making [Kefir Water](https://poseymom.com/pages/water-kefir-instructions) a cultured beverage who shared characteristics with Milk Kefir and Kombucha. You mix kefir grains with water, sugar, and a mineral of some sort. I used molasses. I find the test of Kombucha too acidic, too vinegary. All these beverages provide healthy benefits to the gut (and perhaps the gut-brain axis). Or, at least that's the claim. I'm *not making that claim* but certainly other fermented substances like sauerkraut are very healthy. Anyway, my first batch is now done. It's sweetish and tastes, to quote my sisters, *like pool water that's clean and slightly sweet.* I think that's not a ringing endorsement. But, it was cheap to make a batch and interesting, if only as a science experiment.
