I got an alarming email from *The Epoch Times* (an online screed claiming to be unbiased) about a research study from Lund University:

Aside from the small notification that clicking on the link will auto-create an account for you (how incredibly generous), [the article](https://www.theepochtimes.com/pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-goes-into-liver-cells-and-is-converted-to-dna-study_4307594.html?utm_medium=EmailMk&utm_source=l2&utm_campaign=L2_BN5&utm_term=BN5-03-04-2022&utm_content=brnews1&instaaccount=mikethechap%40gmail.com) begins with: _Alert:Study finds vaccine converted into DNA._ This is, in fact, dangerous misinformation. The [study](https://www.mdpi.com/1467-3045/44/3/73/htm) interpretation has gaping holes. For more on the false nature of this claim, [go here](https://thegrubhound.com/study-by-lund-university-researchers-didnt-show-that-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-change-our-dna/). Want more explanation of the problems with this interpretation of the study? [Go here](https://www.techarp.com/science/pfizer-mrna-vaccine-dna-facts/). 

In short, don't go to the pizza store to fix your plumbing problems.
