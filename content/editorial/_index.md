title: "Deep Dives into research, opinion, ideas, and resources."

In this area, I've highlighted articles and offered my opinions on research, politics, social wellbeing, recent news, and occasionally, even comedy. I chose to keep this section separate from my blog. I regard my blog posts as less about opinion and more about inspiration and the common human experience. Certainly, my opinions have changed dramatically over my lifetime. I'm sure this will continue.
