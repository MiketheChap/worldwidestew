When I was doing research studies, a friend of mine - a brilliant researcher - endlessly reminded me that it was wrong to guess what the data would say. *Mike, you can't say that yet! YOu don't have the data! Even if you think you know what the data will say, you can't make that conclusion until you have the data. 

Often, during the pandemic, we heard people who should have known better telling us *what the data would say*. *This is no worse than the flu.* They had no idea what they were talking about. So, I've revised this article slightly since it's original pulblication. It now reflects more of my frustration with those who drew conclusions when conclusions shouldn't have been drawn. 

* Which is more deadly? COVID-19 or the flu? - [Per Medscape](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/988548) COVID-19, [of course](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2801464). The second link goes to the original article. Who cares? Probably, very few. However, the article does speak to the promise that COVID-19 was no worse than getting the flu. It was, in fact, worse than the flu.
