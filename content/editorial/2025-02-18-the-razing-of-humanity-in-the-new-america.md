>"Saint James the Moor-slayer (Spanish: Santiago Matamoros) is the name given to the representation (painting, sculpture, etc.) of the apostle [James the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_the_Great), as a legendary, miraculous figure who appeared at the also legendary [Battle of Clavijo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Clavijo), helping the Christians conquer the Muslim [Moors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moors)." - from the Wikipedia entry [James Matamoros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Matamoros)

The Trump Administration has no regard for the Rule of Law or the kind of nation that the Founders of the United States intended. The eradication of US Aid programs, the removal of thousands of people's jobs, the despotic behaviors of Administration officials, the abandonment of cases filed to protect the least protected people, and the crossing of the boundaries between Church and State (again, an idea held sacred by the Founders) portend a future where Republican leaders have created a totalitarian state. Republican Congressional leaders like John Cornyn arrogantly and scornfully ignore [constituent's concerns](https://x.com/JohnCornyn/status/1887271813828276442?mx=2). [^1]

When I was much younger, I attended a Christian school that foreshadowed the arrogance and abuses of the current horrors. The school talked a lot about the notion of Holy War. Of course, for the Christian leaders I heard, Holy War was evil if enacted by Muslims (at this point, I'm not sure I can trust that history *hostory*). Even as a teen, I heard people in our Conservative circles toying with the belief that it was okay to overthrow governments, Muslim or otherwise. *We might need to reclaim our nation*, they said. 

I remember a friend who bragged about going to parks to *beat up* homosexuals. 

All of this was prophetic of an Inaugural Insurrection where people are killed in the name of America being Great again. Senators and Representatatives sit idly by while the President and his coterie flaunt his fearless hatred for anything other than pride, greed, and arrogance. 

Sadly, much of this has happened with the overt approval of those who claim to be people of faith, most specifically Christians. 

I repudiate this version of Christianity. It has nothing to do with God. 

In the picture above, Matamoros imagined the Apostle, James the Great leading the Christian (Right?) into battle against the Muslim Moors. After all, if the Crusades were right then, they must be right now? No they weren't then. They aren't now. And they weren't then. 

All people who love humanity and faith must sternly press back against these abuses. 

If you voted for Trump and his colleagues but didn't see this coming, welcome. It's possiblle that your voice matters more than anyone elses. Please step up for your fellow human beings. Join a protest.

â€™s nominees & all the good work @ElonMusk is doing with @DOGE. I hate to break it to them, but we are just getting started. These people are really going to lose it when we extend the Trump tax cuts." - Did Senator Cornyn really mean to suggest that Musk's acessing of personal accounts was a *good job*?
