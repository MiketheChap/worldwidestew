And then we ended up with what can only be called a [fascist dictatorship](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fascism)(Merriam-Webster definition at the link). At this point, the scaffolding that held up any form of democracy is quickly eroding, like hurricane-force winds along the shoreline. 

My father was a warrior, a Colonel in the United States Army. My brother served bravely in the United States Army, as did my nephew. Though I would have honored the draft if I had been called up, the draft didn't need me when it came time. I've always felt like I didn't entirely live up to my Dad's vision of our family's military service. 

I am scared (I debated using the word *worried* or *scared*: you see I ended up with *scared*). Those who are sworn to serve Texas (where I live) and the United States are in thrall (or have been corrupted) by a perverse vision of America allowing them to excuse every abuse that the Founding Fathers wanted for the country they created. They believe their vision - one where they imagine they are God's instruments - gives them a *blank check* for any action. This is the reason for my fears. In an extraordinarily short time we have seen widespread attacks on education, the judiciary, the free press, law firms, legislatures, the *scientific method*, the poor, immigrants, and the economy. 

The Governor of California spoke to the threat facing the United States (and, indeed, the world) as a result of the current President of the United States, his facist leadership, and the Republican leadership. I hope you'll watch it in it's entirety.
