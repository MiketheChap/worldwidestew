When I started Worldwide Stew, I intended the Blog area of the site to be generally positive in tone. I would reserve the Opinion area [of the site](https://worldwidestew.com/editorial) for news and opinions about science, health, politics, and fun stuff. 

And then we ended up with what can only be called a [fascist Administration](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fascism)(Merriam-Webster definition at the link). At this point, the scaffolding that held up any form of democracy is quickly eroding, like hurricane-force winds along the shoreline. 

This is the reason why I feel the need to allow some Blog posts to reflect concerns about equity, character, justice, freedom, courage, bias, and kindness. I will still keep the great bulk of my political posts on the Opinions area. But, I when I'm concerned about character or coping with life's hardness and it's causes, I may put the post here. 

The Governor of California spoke to the threat facing the United States (and, indeed, the world) as a result of the current President of the United States, his facist leadership, and the Republican leadership. I hope you'll watch it in it's entirety.
