description: "Apple notifications are merely annoying. The Religious Right is scary. We've seen the Religious and Politcal Right before. We should be worried."
summary: "I've liked my iPhone. Except for notifications. Google did them much better. But, that's just an annoyance. The Religious Right and it's efforts to create a love child with our political leaders is downright scary. We should be very scared. All of us. Even the good people who subscribe."

#### Apple Notifications
Apple notifications are appbysmal (did you see what I did there?) - I've been using an iPhone for about 9 months now. I can't tell you how many meetings I've been late for or missed (when I would have made them on time using Android notifications). Am I alone on this? No. [Read more here](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/using-android-phone-showed-me-how-bad-ios-iphone-notifications-are/?amp). Frankly, iOS is long overdue fixing this. Events should be front-and-center. There are some meetings I don't want to miss.

#### The Religious Right and Theocracy have little to do with God
Here in Texas the Intolerant Right is fervently trying to create their version of a theocracy. Sadly, the Religious Right happily endorses this power grab. Actually, the Intolerant Right and the Religious Right are probably the same thing. The fact that many of them are [actually religious](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/religious-landscape-study/political-ideology/conservative/) in any conventional sense doesn't matter. Nor is there any necessarily any connection The point is power, not faith. 

The other day, we got a flyer in the mail asking for changes in schools that *put parents back in the drivers seat.* Lets be clear about the subtext of this fanaticism: 
- *Book-burning* - get rid of the books (and history) that vary from their curated history (remove evolution, our badly checkered history of being anti-Black, anti-Hispanic, anti-Jew, anti-Muslim), 
- Remove teachers who espouse any views other than the approved views,
- Remove economic views that conflict with neoliberalism,
- Removal of government oversight wherever possible, 
- Elimination of any consideration of any position on reproductive freedom that differs from theirs. 
- Among other positions

Honestly, though, I'm open to the same criticism: I find much of organized religion is odious, not open to diversity, and far too political. I want Father Brown, not the mega-church pastor who hasn't seen one of his *lesser parishioners* in the past month.
