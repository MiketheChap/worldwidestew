[https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010171](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010171) - an app to predict COVID conditions not unlike a weather app. It would likely be useful in many other places but not in the US because we lack the resolve to report our health issues and problems. If it deals with us, we're likely okay with it. If it means protecting our communities (at the cost of any independence), we don't want to help on any collective level.

Does the cost of your car make you less likely to yield to pedestrians? Very probably, yes, according to [this](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214140520300359) What are the implications of this on social economies and the social contract?
