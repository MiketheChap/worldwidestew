This post originated with the creation of a [blog post on New Year's Resolutions](https://worldwidestew.com/blog/2025-12-27-wait-before-you-make-any-resolutions/). I'm trying to keep my blog area focused on inspiration. So, instead of posting this in that area, I'm adding it to my website's opinion section. 

Yesterday, on my blog, I suggested some reasons that *resolution brain* lets us down:
- It fixates on our failures, deficits, and weaknesses
- It promotes suffering by triggering loss of hope and depression when resolutions fail \
- It highlights our sense of *not enough*: we don't have enough, we aren't enough, and the *Hungry Ghost* of wanting more\

Today, I want to highlight a few of the more insidious ways that *resolution brain* betrays us. 
- The Resolution Industry is manufactured. The self-improvement industry is active all year long. We aren't good enough:  in some way our eating, smell, possessions, exercise, and clothing, are inadequate. We are constantly told that we aren't good enough. 
- I've been particularly troubled by the appeals to young people who are automatically inclined toward self-comparison. So,   newly created intimate deodorants and cleansers suggest that the most personal aspects of a person are themselves inadequate. In response, people begin an entirely new addiction to environmentally invasive products. Some of these products may harm the body's natural biome. 
- The New Year's timing. Using our inadequacies to promote sales on the New Year transition is particularly galling. 
- Many sellers hypocritically tell us that we're all beautiful, immediately turning around and suggesting other areas of inadequacy.
- The Resolution Industry creates false urgency and crisis. They tell us this with the *specific intent* of inciting *fight or flight* thinking. \
\
What to do in response to this *psychological ghost lighting*? 
- Teach our children (and ourselves) to act from strength
- Shareholders should say, *No*, to companies using shame, ghost-lighting, and fight-or-flight triggering 
- Use the least invasive methods to make the world safer, more pleasant, and comfortable. 
- Adapt to our environment with gentleness. Everything in life exists on a spectrum of more or less pleasant. We should try to learn to accept life on life on it's own terms. As a hospital chaplain, the body had a spectrum of smells; some were pleasant, some weren't. You learned to adapt or work around the smells of the body (coffee grounds helped with the harder ones!). But, excellent providers never, ever, shamed people for their conditions. We shouldn't shame ourselves, either. \

So, just in time for New Years, that's my rant on commercialism by the *Resolution Industry* with specific criticism directed at the hygiene industry.
