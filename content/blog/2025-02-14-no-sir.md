>  "I haven't in the 23 years that I have been in the uniformed services of the USA ever violated an order, not one." - [Oliver North, Iran-Contra Affair testimony](https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1789&context=noticen). 

I grew up in a military family. *Yes, Sir. No, Sir.* You were supposed to follow orders. Not the orders you chose, but all orders. Perhaps *Oliver North* wouldn't have ended up in the [Iran-Contra Scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair) if he had chosen to disobey illegal orders. But, he didn't. Because orders were orders. 

History is riddled with people who've followed orders because they were orders. If the person above me says to do something, that's all the authority I need to do something. 

That was at the heart of Stanley Milgram's *[Obedience Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment)*. His big question was, *How far will you go in following orders? Will you harm other people if an expert tells you it's what you're supposed to do*? 

What Milgram's experiment highlighted was the need to reset how we teach obedience. Our education should balance with the need for critical thinking and moral judgment. As part of their experience, children should learn that respectful disagreement is not just acceptable but sometimes necessary. We might even provide practical experiences along those lines. 

Parents want their children to follow directions. But they should also want them to follow *moral directions*. So, as well as teaching our children to respect and obey, we should teach them to have enough self-respect - respect for their own moral compass - that they can say *No, Sir* (notice the Sir). *No, Sir* combines an appropriate respect for authority *and* self-respect. 

A former boss taught me a valuable lesson about all this: *How do we teach employees to say 'This isn't appropriate? You can't talk to us like this.' We should have enough self-respect for our professional roles to say, 'you can't talk to me like this.'*

My boss's words contrasted with what I heard as a child: *follow orders, do what you're told*. The alternative she offered was, *The way you talked to us is not acceptable.*

The balance between respect and self-respect isn't just about parenting or workplace dynamics - it's about creating a society where moral courage is as valued as orderly conduct. When we teach our children to say 'No, Sir' when necessary, we're preparing them to be both respectful and ethically strong. Terrible things can happen if we don't harness the ability to say, No. 

And to N., whose wisdom during that meeting helped reset my moral compass: thank you for teaching me this valuable lesson about balancing respect with self-respect.
