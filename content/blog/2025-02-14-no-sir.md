>  "I haven't in the 23 years that I have been in the uniformed services of the USA ever violated an order, not one." - [Oliver North, Iran-Contra Affair testimony](https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1789&context=noticen). 

I grew up in a military family. *Yes, Sir. No, Sir.* You were supposed to follow orders. Not the orders you chose, but all orders. Perhaps [Oliver North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_North) - who chose to follow all orders - wouldn't have ended up testifying before Cngress in the [Iran-Contra Scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair) if he had chosen to disobey illegal orders. But, he didn't. Because *orders were orders*. 

History is riddled with people who've followed orders because they were orders. If the person above me says to do something, that's all the authority I need to do something. 

That was at the heart of Stanley Milgram's *[Obedience Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment)*. His big question was, *How far will you go in following orders? Will you harm other people if an expert tells you it's what you're supposed to do*? 

Milgram's experiment had three participants. Two of them were part of the research team, an actor playing The Doctor. And another actor *pretending* to be the research subject. The third participant was some poor guy hired to help out with the study. He didn't know that *he was really the Subject*. They wanted to see how far the hired guy (my poor guy) would go to follow the Dr's. orders. This poor guy sits just outside a lab room. Inside is the Confederate actor who is supposed to pretend he's being harmed. The subject is supposed to read a series of words through a microphone to the confederate actor. This confederate is supposed to repeat the series of words back without error. There, in front of the poor hired guy is a panel with a series of switches attached to electrodes supposedly attached to the body of the Confederate. The Subject is told that the guy inside the room is wired up to the electrodes and that he, the Subject, will shock the Confederate in the room with increasingly deadly shocks for each wrongly repeated series of words. Remember, the Subject doesn't know the guy in the room, the Confederate, is actually part of the study and that nothing is really happening to him. He doesn't know that the screams, moans, and then the deathly silence aren't actually indicators of harm. But there's one more actor on the research team: *Mr. Dr. Guy in The White Coat Who Knows What's Really Right*. Every time this poor Subject begins to listen to *his moral compass*, says that the guy in the room is screamimg, Mr. Dr. Guy in The White Coat Who Knows What's Really Right tells Mr. Trying-to-get-by-Common-Man to proceed with a shock, even if the Confederate in the room is wailing in (fake) pain. Even if the next switch has a label saying the shock will be lethal. 

This study harmed a number of Mr. Trying-to-get-by-Common-Men (they were probably decent, good human beings and I think I would have liked them all). They believed they were harming the Confederate, especially when he quit screaming and moaning? It's gut-wrenching to watch. Could you live with being *that obedient?* Milgram's study could never be done today (although I'm starting to wonder if that's still the case with recent governmental changes). Far too many people were willing to switch the lethal Switch because *Mr. Dr. Guy in The White Coat Who Knows What's Really Right* told them to. See a video of the Milgram study below (if you can stomach it).

What Milgram's experiment highlighted was the need to reset how we teach obedience. Our education should balance obedience with the need for critical thinking and moral judgment. As part of their experience, children should learn that respectful disagreement, even disobedience, is not just acceptable but sometimes necessary. We might even provide practical experiences along those lines. 

Parents want their children to follow directions. But they should also want them to follow *moral directions*. So, as well as teaching our children to respect and obey, we should teach them to have enough self-respect - respect for their own moral compass - to say *No, Sir* (notice the Sir). *No, Sir* combines an appropriate respect for authority *and* self-respect. 

A former boss taught me a valuable lesson about all this: *How do we teach employees to say 'This isn't appropriate? You can't talk to us like this.' We should have enough self-respect for our professional roles to say, 'you can't talk to me like this.'*

My boss's words contrasted with what I heard as a child: *follow orders, do what you're told*. The alternative she offered was, *The way you talked to us is not acceptable.*

The balance between respect and self-respect isn't just about parenting or workplace dynamics - it's about creating a society where moral courage is as valued as orderly conduct. When we teach our children to say 'No, Sir' when necessary, we're preparing them to be both respectful and ethically strong. Terrible things can happen if we don't harness the ability to say, No. 

And to N., whose wisdom during that meeting helped reset my moral compass: thank you for teaching me this valuable lesson about balancing respect with self-respect.

Another part of this equation is *courage*. You have to possess the courage necessary to live with the consequences of saying, No. The parent-child relationship is the perfect space for children to practice both listening to their moral compass and leveling up the courage to respectfully decline what is asked of them.
