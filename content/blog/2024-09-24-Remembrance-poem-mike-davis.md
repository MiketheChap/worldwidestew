##### Remembrance
There was that moment
That instant when you were called to a strength,
To exercise a wisdom for which you felt unprepared, 
And maybe unjustified to exercise
A moment for which there was no personal plan
No guideline
No idea.
It just was. 

You were called to make choices
on the fly.
To protect self
and loved ones.
Unsure the extent, location, or proximity 
of what you feared.

You had to draw only 
on your best instinct. 
You had to think your most intuitive thoughts
Not running, exactly,
But moving with caution, 
thought,
spirit, 
and deliberation.

Looking for those with whom you could huddle
And those from whom you must hide.

You survived because you listened. 
Because you listened to your inner caution
But not too much. You must still go on. 

You survived because you knew to stop and take stock
But not too long. Keep moving until known safe. 
You survived because you looked for help
And weighed whom you could trust.

You survived because you considered what might come,
and from where,
but avoided attachment to one place. 

You survived because you thought, 
weighed, 
and forged ahead,
In spite of risk.

Today, distant from that place and time.
Even now, those resources aren't far away.
You can - and would - do it all again
If you needed to. 
Those resources sprung up from within you
From your experiences, 
From your wisdom,
From your trust (and distrust),
From uncertainty (and internal assurance).
For some moment today,
Sit back and try to trust the Inner You
The You with doubts and fears, 
Hopes and dreams.
The You who's responsive, 
Whose inner River, 
Will ebb and crest, 
When you listen and need it most. 

Mike Davis
