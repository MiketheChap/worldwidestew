#### Remembrance
by Mike Davis

There was that moment  
The instant when you were called  
To find an unknown strength,  
To exercise a wisdom for which you felt unprepared,  
And maybe unjustified to exercise  
A moment for which there was no personal plan  
No guideline  
No idea.  
It just was.  

You were called to make choices  
on the fly.  
To protect self,  
loved ones, or both  
Unsure the extent, location, or proximity  
of what you feared.  

All you had  
Was your best instinct.  
Your most intuitive thoughts.   
Not running, exactly,  
But moving with caution,  
thought,  
spirit,  
and deliberation.  

Looking for those  
with whom you could safely huddle  
And avoiding those  
From whom you must hide.  

You survived because you listened.  
Because you listened to your inner caution  
But not too much. You had to go on.  
You survived because you knew to stop  
And take stock,  
But not too long.  

You survived because you considered what might come,  
and from where,  
but also because you avoided attachment  
to any one place.  

Today, distant from that place and time.  
Even now, those resources aren't far away.  
You can - and would - do it all again  
If you needed to.  
Those resources sprung up from within you  
From your experiences,  
From your wisdom,  
From your trust (and distrust),  
From uncertainty (and internal assurance).  
For some moment today,  
Sit back and try to trust the Inner You  
The You with doubts and fears,  
Hopes and dreams.  
The You who's responsive,  
Whose strong inner River,  
Will crest and ebb,  
When you listen and need it most.  

Mike Davis
