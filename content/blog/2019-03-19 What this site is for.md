summary: "Wherein mike ponders the meaning of Worldwide Stew. What purpose does it serve?"

It occurred to me a while back that I had no direction for Worldwide Stew. It was okay, though, because I was putting most of my thoughts and links on Google +. I'm regretting that these days. Indeed, like other areas of life where I feel I've been missing a plan or intention, that's been the case here.  
  
No more. I'm not sure how regular this experiment will be, but it will have some purpose.  

1.  Curation - if I find an article or web page I think readers would like, I will post it here along with why I think it's worthwhile 
2.  Original thought - most of what is currently here falls under this category (though not all). 
3.  Reviews - if I find some product, software, or idea I think is worth pursuing (or the opposite, as was the case with the SoClean CPAP cleaner), I'll post it here.
4.  Events- if I think there's an event that will improve your life and make you happier, I'll put it here.

So, here's my plan moving forward.
