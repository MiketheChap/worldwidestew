>Satisfaction guaranteed or your money back.

When someone says, *Satisfaction guaranteed or your money back* they are upping the value of their promise. They are saying, *You have nothing to lose.* 

But, even if you are able to get your money back, you've still lost something: *time and trust*. Broken trust steadily erodes our lives and connections. The return of our money can't return the time and hope for a resolution to our problem. 

Here's a promise we *can make* that is more than a come-on and more than words:

> *Here. I made this for you. I hope it delights you. That's what I was hoping for. If it didn't delight you, what can I do to fix things?* 

Sometimes, we all miss the mark. That's human. And, it's nothing to fret about.[^1] Society, though, tells us the economy is all about making as much money as you can and saying whatever you have to say. That's broken. A healthy society and economy are about promises in our interactions, trust, and care for one another. Promising your money back is the least we can hope for. 

[^1]: Additionally, some people just can't be delighted (or even satisfied). That's on them.
