We have a favorite park where we take Cassie, our dog. It's lavishly shaded and beautifully wooded. 

It's been showing it's age. Once lovely educational signs marred by vandals or water-damaged. 

Recently, though, it's clear that work's been done to clear brush and make it look better. We even found a newly refurbished cut-off trail. 

I'm asking you, Deaar Reader, to trust me for a minute. I avoid politics in this area of my site. This area is for inspiration and making things better. And, even though I'm bringing politics in, I don't thinks you'll mind. I pray you won't. I'd like to think we're friends, okay? You know, like we're at the pub, slightly dancing around the edge of difficult subjects, but then discovering we're not that different after all. I'm trying to inspire that kind of thought. 

The lovely park has suffered with lack of attention. But, as Conservative Republicans in the US constatnly remind us, we've been spending endless amounts of moneuof things we can't afford. This is what hit me. We use the park all the time. Maybe we wouldn't have to pay thousands of dollars to have a crew come in and clear the dead trees and brush. Maybe, we ourselves, those of us who can, should show up for a work day at the park?

I don't agree with they cynicism of the left that offers a disgusting and arrogant *too bad* for people who can't afford things. I have no warm feelings for those who are unscrupulously wealthy or narcissistic. Their insensitivity makes my skin crawl. 

But, I think we've come to depend on *the government* for things we should all be part of. We need to pay for the services people need. We need to pay for quality product testing, for safety testing, and for prosecution of those who take advantage of the poor. We must provide a safety net. 

But, it's also time for us to personally support the things we think are important with our time, knowledge, possessions, and money. We can't expect government and taxes to cover all we need. That isn't a way to run a society. 

We have to stop passing off our jobs as citizens. We have to return to times where we all voted. We participated in work days. We showed up for the recently bereaved. It was our job as much as it was someone elses work. 

We've handed off the things that make societies resilient. It's time to get back to work, real work, all together, in our communities.
