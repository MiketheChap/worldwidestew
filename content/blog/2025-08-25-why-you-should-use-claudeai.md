You're a hygienic person. You bathe. Brush your teeth. Wash your hands before meals and after going to the bathroom. That's awesome! You're smart like that.

Hopefully, you're equally hygienic in the digital aspects of your life. You use a password protector because you understand you're little *password list* isn't immune to being hacked (it isn't). Because you use a password protector, you also never reuse passowrds. Obviously, the more you reuse passwords, the bigger your digital footprint if you get hacked. You avoid the bad practices of social networks (if not avoiding them altogether). You know that figuring out *Facebook's* data-sharing settings are a nightmare. You understand that social networks are full of negative social *contagions* which can negatively affect your mental health. 

But, you may not be as familiar with *artificial intelligence hygiene*. *Large Language Models* pose distinct and not yet fully realized dangers. Unfortunately, our craving for the promises of AI blinds us: *What could possibly go wrong?* Lots.
