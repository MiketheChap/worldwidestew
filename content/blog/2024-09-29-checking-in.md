>*Describe your pain*, the doctor said.

>*Burning, Shooting. Stabbing. And, burning again. Oh, and stabbing again.* 

Part of becoming more mindful is *awareness of physical sensations*.  This might be fullness/hunger, tension, anxiety (that feeling in the *pit of the stomach that something not good is coming*), or pain. Other examples are tightness in the facial muscles, neck, back, shoulders or head. There are also emotional sensations we should *check in for*. Thongs like the anxety we mentioned  earlier. Other examples are fatigue, depression, guilt, sadness, and anger. 

But, as much as we might think *checking in* has to do with negative sensations, it’s a mistake to limit it to the negative. It also has to do with positive sensations: looseness, freedom, attention, flow, awe, kindness, and gratitude. Each one of these has identified and specific variants. As an example of a positive sensation, after completing a stressful situation, we might feel *like a enormous weight was taken off.* In our modern society, we would blow right past that sensation. That would be a big mistake! We should learn to *savor it*!

Yesterday morning, after I woke up, I didn’t need to *officially* check in with my body (as important as that is to do): my body made it’s voice known the moment I got out of bed. I hurt. Sorenoess from arthritis and burning/stabbing from sciatica. A BIG OUCH! It’s North Texas so my allergies were alive, too. 

But, Cassie, my dog, wanted nothing less than a thorough walk. So we walked. 

About three-quarters of the way through, I *checked in* with my body again. My pain was substantially less. I’m not asking for gone. I’m hoping for *less*. And, I was listening to a podcast and *learned something new*. I arrived home in a substantially happier mood than when I left!

Two observations stood out for me: 
1. *Checking in* is good. *Checking in* regularly is better. Making a habit of checking in is esssential. 
2. I’m not sure who said it, but as a general principle, *motion is lotion*. Get up often from our chairs and walk. 

One final note: any management book worth buying is going to stress the importance of *rounding on your employees*. If your management book doesn’t mention rounding, throw it back. If you want your employees to care about your wishes, you better care about their’s. 

Not coincidentally, another synonym for *rounding* is *checking in*. The same principle applies to our body as it does to our employees: blindness to either one is a recipe for a slow erosion of health and strength.
