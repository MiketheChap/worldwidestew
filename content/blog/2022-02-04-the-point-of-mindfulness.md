When I first started my meditation practice, I was frustrated that I couldn't go for thirty seconds without being distracted: *Gotta work harder at that, you fool*, I'd say to myself. 

Even in that last statement, I revealed not one, but two problems. First, that meditation is about working or *working harder*. It isn't. It's about practicing observation and when we become distracted - as we will - gently and kindly returning our minds to whatever we are observing. 

The second problem is in my last statement: *gently and kindly*. There was nothing kind in calling myself a Fool. Noticing that I did that gives me an opportunity to be kinder next time. 

Both these problems are interrelated: *kindness and working*. They are negative, noticing failure and judging it. They aren't growth-oriented. This is practice. It is gentle. Mindfulness, *correctly practiced* avoids violence to oneself or others. 

Just practice kindly. <- Did you see what I did there? I'm :wink: at you.
