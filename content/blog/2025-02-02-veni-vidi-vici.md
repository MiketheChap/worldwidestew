*Veni, Vidi, Vici*

This phrase, Latin for *I came, I saw, I conquered*, was reportedly uttered by Julius Caesar. At least that's what my high school Latin teacher and [Wikipedia say](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veni,_vidi,_vici). Wikipedia says it refers to a *swift, decisive victory.*

Today, we visited a family member's new home, which is under construction. Here's a magic marker. *Write something that might be meaningful*, we were asked. What an honor!

I suppose it's an indicator of my *mental status* that I thought of Caesar's quote. But, instead of *conquest*, I thought of *love*. Love should fit the spirit a home. Even when things are hard (and they will be), we can still love. 

Thus, 

*Veni, Vidi, Amavi*

Or

*I came. I saw. I loved.*

Whatever else is going on, and whatever our challenges are, Tyranny never wins.

The everyday doors into our homes -- and our hearts -- merit a tangible, loving nod every time we come and go. Nothing in life is guaranteed, especially love and warmth.
