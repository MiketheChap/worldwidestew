The days are cooler with the onset of Fall and Winter. My skin cuts more easily. It's dried out. 

You, too?

Lotion may be part of the answer. It might help the scratches, the itching, and it might reduce skin discomfort. 

But, I've brought up lotion for another reason. I want to encourage you to apply it regularly. Slowly. Thoughtfully. Mindfully. 

Notice how it feels to touch the skin. To care for myself. To feel the fingertips glide across the skin. What does the sensation of added moisture feel like?

This is what self-compassion looks and feels like. This is why sefl-compassion matters. 

Our bodies skin - and, our mental skin - have more protection. They are more resilient. We have potentially *scratching* encounters every day. When we've applied lotion every day, we are softer, yet more resilient. We are better able to take the buffet of daily life. We r3ecover quicker. 

Quick. Go get your lotion. Your dermatologist would want you to anyway. My dermatologist always reminds me to apply more, not less, lotion. Go. Now. Take time. Go slow. Show yourself some love.
