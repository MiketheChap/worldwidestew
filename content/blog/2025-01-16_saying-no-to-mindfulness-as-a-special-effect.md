In matters of popular mindfulness, caution is appropriate. 

Any day I expect to see someone in the *mindfulness industrial complex* promise to lead me in a twelve-minute meditation freeing me from my guilt over my many prior mistakes, misjudgments, sins, and cruelties (don’t be surprised by that statement: unless you’re a narcissist, you have all of them, too). They will promise healing through crystals, diets, oils, and charms. 

I’m told I don’t have a dirty mind* and I’m too trusting. That’s probably true. 

No one can clear that conscience. It’s there and hopefully it's appropriaately remorseful. That’s exactly why it’s there. That’s part of how we learn. 

Mindfulness isn’t intended to be a special effect. It helps make life a little more tolerable. That’s it. And, a twelve minute practice doesn’t do that. 

Nor will a visit to your local confessional. We carry the price of our misbehaviors and mistakes in our consciences. This is good. This is human. 

There are ways to modulate the pain of our guilt: taking responsibility, make reparations (where possible), and asking forgiveness. Nothing, though, wipes the slate clean. 

Let your conscience be. As much as you can, thank your conscience for the work it's trying to do, for it's teaching. Pushing your conscience away only assures it's continued close presence. Do what you can to learn from the past. 

But, don’t waste your money on false promises of mindfulness. Mindfulness can help. But it’s not a miracle. Indeed, I’m not sure we need miracles. At least not the twelve-minute kind, crystals, and other paraphernalia. 

Unless you like the crystal and can afford it. Then, by all means buy it. But, only because the crystal makes you happy!
