We look forward to retirement as though the work just goes away. Rethink.

A neighbor said, *I keep thinking that someday my chore list will grow shorter.*

Thatâ€™s probably not going to be a happy day,

We need our chores. They give us something to do. They give us purpose. We can certainly pair down the unnecessary chores, the ones that donâ€™t serve the greater good or our own good. But, rue the day when your chore list goes away. More people than you can imagine will be crying.ðŸ˜­
