When a doctor or Advance Practice Provider (like a Physician Assitant or Nurse Practitioner)issues a verbal order, the person taking the order is usuaqlly supposed to read it back to confirm understanding. Clinicians often feel its unncessary: *We're in a hurry.We've got things to do.*

Verbal order readback (VORB) is an invitation. It’s an invitation to reduce confusion or dispel doubts. With VORB, the person *receiving* the order and the person *giving* the order have the opportunity to *dance*. *Do you understand what I want? Do I understand what you’re reporting?* We get to do this before we step on each other’s toes. Or, more importantly, before we hurt the patient or family.

VORB isn’t a bad communication device for a family, either. *I’m not ignoring you. We’re just not understanding each other. This is human. Let’s start over.*

It's easy to get frustrated if either person *thinks they're not being taken seriously or the other person isn't paying attention*. The purpose of verbal order read back – at work or home - is to make sure that we're all *growing* in the same direction. I intended to say *rowing* but it came out growing. Sometimes I yell at spell check. But, when I read it back this time, *growing sounded better*.
