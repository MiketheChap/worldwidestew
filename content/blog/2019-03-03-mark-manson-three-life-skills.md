Curated: 3 important skills that Nobody Ever Taught You
If you haven't read _3 Important Life Skills Nobody Ever Taught You_ yet, imagine a good father figure - if you can - at a moment when he is willing to risk talking and you are willing to really hear. Are you there?  
  
Imagine, Mark Manson suggests, that this father figure (that you may have to conjure) tells you 3 things that no one ever learns but are nonetheless absolutely essential life skills.  
  
And, they are. The advice you're going to get, in typical Manson, will freely use profane language. You may or may not be comfortable with that. I assure you, however, that there's some pretty sound advice here. So, what are you waiting for?
