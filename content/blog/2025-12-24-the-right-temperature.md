### A clean surface and the right heat make real connections.

For the past couple of months I've been working on our 2025 holiday lights. 

{{< youtube YA-Xw9dGVbI >}}

This year, I wanted to do something new. It required numerous electronic solder connections. Lots of them. It's tedious work connecting electronic components to each other. When you don't get the *surface of the printed circuit board, the components, AND the solder hot enough, you get what's called a *cold solder joint.* It's the curse of all solderers! You power up your project and, after all that work, it won't power up right. It's likely a *cold solder joint.*

To make electronic solder connections work, you need to do two things. 
- Carefully clean the boards with rubbing alcohol, flux, or both. 
- Heat the solder hot enough so it can completely melt the solder without burning the connections or making it splatter. 

Soldering is similar to building connections in life. First, we have to clean our surfaces of our prejudices, assumptions, and pre-conceptions. It's hard to imagine how many potentially beautiful relationships never happened, never merged, because the *surfaces* were corrupted by the residue of past harms, flawed ideas, and the unwillingness to explore what might be verus what was. 

Cleaning the surfaces is often the hardest work. 
1. Are we really prepared at this time in life for the kind of *melting* that happens with connections. If you're studying for a doctorate, you *might* not be able to devote the time necessary for a relationship. How willing are we to adapt our lives to the necessities of others. 
2. Sometimes we have negative prior experiences (for example with controlling people or bosses) that should give us pause. We might have been connected with strong religious traditions. FOr instance, I was very connected with fundamentalist Christianity. I remain wary of religiously controlling people. 
3. We might engage useful tools like:
    - The VIA Character Strengths Survey 
    - Therapy (I've done my share!)
    - Other types of screenings and assessments (work interest, sexxuality preferences, etc.). YOur willingness to explore new knowledge about yourself says a lot! 
4. Commit fully to a relationship in the belief there's something to learn (and something to teach) 

When we've done the work of cleaning off the residue, we're ready to build something new! First, we need heat. To make the metals perfectly merge, we need the connection to be hot. Not too hot. BUt, certainly, not too cold, either. When the right heat and the elements are close togetherm we get that beautiful, shiny surface marking the perfect connection. The *heat* of relationships evolves from being really present.
1. Minimizing distractions
2. Honoring (and adapting to change) in the type and commitments of our relationships. People change 
4. Being honest (even when it's not comfortable)
5. Committing fully to the relationship

The biggest task of adulthood is building and sustaining meaningful connections. This means relinquishing past residue, finding new connections, and sustaining them by our presence and commitment.
