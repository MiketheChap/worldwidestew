summary: "We all want to believe in the impossible. We, you and me, will never die. Or, at best, it's will be far into the future: we don't need to worry about it now. Nothing could be farther from the truth. This true story tells how wrogn our assumptions can be."

###### Knowing our limits

A well-known study,  [*Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect), explored the disturbing likelihood that the more we tend to think ourselves experts on a subject, the less likely we are to be correct. The opposite is also true: the less we think we know about any subject, the more expert we probably are. This phenomenon is called the Dunning-Kruger Effect, named after David Dunning and Justin Kruger. 

Here's the background. When captured, a bank robber, McArthur Wheeler, was dismayed that police had been able to identify him, even if they *did use the bank camera*. Police shouldn't have been able to identify him because he "*Wore the juice*". The juice should have hidden his ide
When police pressed him further about *the juice* he explained that he'd covered himself with lemon juice. As you may know, lemon juice is used in *invisible ink*. So, if he was covered in the juice - invisible ink - he should have been invisible. He assumed a level of expertise about lemon juice he didn't possess. 

We shouldn't be too quick to laugh at poor Mr. Wheeler. Dunning and Kruger's research suggested that humans routinely do this. 

As many Living Wills and Medical Powers of Attorney as I've done, I realize I'm still learning. Still, it's hard when a patient or family member - feeling a sense of expertise - won't listen to feedback from someone who's done these and seen the results of advance directives done poorly. Or, the sometimes tragic results when patients ignore doctors suggestions. Often, they are readmitted in worse condition than when they insisted on leaving. If they survive at all. But, of course, they know *best*, they have to go home and take care of a business matter, or they have to _________ ___ ___ . 

With Mr. Wheeler's voice of surprise they say, \*But, I was wearing the juice.

#### A further note on the DUnning-Kruger Effect. 
Recently, studies were done clarifiying the Dunning-Kruger Effect. It seems that we all think we know lots of things about everything. That hasn't changed. But, clarify if I'm wrong, it now seems that the TRUE experts are still TRUE experts. -> In their fields. But, outside their areas of expertise? Yup, they're just like the rest of us saps. They get bit by the juice just like we do.
