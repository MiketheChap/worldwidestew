#### Nothing else matters
By Mike Davis 

Yesterday...<br>
After the dog's bath.<br>
My wife ambled her way to the garage door.<br>
I let our dog down her ramp<br>
And out of the car.<br>
<br>
I watched our dog<br>
Follow her Momma<br>
To the door.<br>
<br>
While my wife unlocked the door<br> 
I watched them both<br>
From the car.<br>  
Both my girls.<br>  
The Beauties I live for.<br>  
<br>
My feelings in that moment<br>    
Were all gratitude<br> 
For it's simplicity<br>  
Nothing else mattered.<br>  
<br>
No event could eclipse<br> 
That picture in my mind.<br>  
That was all there was<br>
Right then.<br>  
The expanse of my World,<br>  
Was funneled<br>  
Into 63 cubic feet.<br>  
But 63 cubic feet<br>  
Were more expansive<br>  
Than all the Universe.<br>  
<br>
Only a fleeting cluster of photons,<br>  
Filtered into an optic nerve,<br>  
Gratitude distilled in a millisecond.<br>
