#### Nothing else matters
By Mike Davis 

Yesterday...  
After the dog's bath.  
My wife ambled her way to the garage door.  
I let our dog down her ramp  
And out of the car.  

I watched our dog  
Follow her Momma  
To the door.  

While my wife unlocked the door  
I watched them both  
From the car.  
Both my girls.  
The Beauties I live for.  

My feelings in that moment    
Were all gratitude  
For it's simplicity  
Nothing else mattered.  

No event could eclipse  
That picture in my mind.  
That was all there was.  
The expanse of my World,  
Was funneled   
Into 63 cubic feet.  
But 63 cubic feet  
Were more expansive  
Than all the Universe.  

Only a fleeting capture of photons,  
Filtered into an optic nerve,  
Gratitude distilled in a millisecond.
