During a meditataion today, right when I was getting into my mental space, a notification came through. 

We're taught that it's good etiquette to mute ourselves when we join meetings. That's a really appropriate thing to do unless you're hosting the meeting. 

But, we might also take the next step step and turn off our notifications. If you're on iOS (Apple) these are fiund under your Focus settings. 

Don't be like me, getting interrupted right when you *get into the Zone*. Show up for yourself with care. Turn off distractions and Notifications. They'll be there later. 

**Do two things in this order when you join your meetings**:
- Mute yourself (unless your the Host, in which case, Unmute yourself)
- Turn off Notificaitons.
