During a meditation today, right when I was getting into my space of mental clarity, a notification came through. 

It's good online meeting etiquette to mute ourselves when we join meetings, unless you're hosting the meeting. 

But, we might also take **the next step** and **turn off our notifications**. If you're on iOS (Apple) these are found under your [Focus settings](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/set-up-a-focus-iphd6288a67f/ios). 

Don't be like me. Avoid interruptions right when you *get into the Zone*. Show up for yourself with care. Turn off distractions and Notifications. They'll be there later. 

**Do two things in this order when you join your meetings**:
- Mute yourself (unless your the Host, in which case, Unmute yourself)
- Turn off Notificaitons.
