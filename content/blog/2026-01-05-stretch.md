*Cassie, let’s go for a walk.*

Cassie, our dog responds more slowly than usual. She usually gets to the door first. She's feeling lazy this morning. Finally, at another beckon, she arises. But, as she does, she takes a long, deep stretch. Her body lengthens. She twists like her body is a towel being wrung out. Then, she releases a full-body shake.

Now, she was ready to go. Our walk could begin. Our day could officially begin. 

Have you stretched today? How good would a big, long stretch feel? Maybe you'd like to try?
