My sciatica is getting painful again. It’s uncomfortable most of the time. 

Part of the mindfulness growth process is awareness of body sensations. Yesterday morning, when I *checked in* with my body, I hurt. But, Cassie, my dog, would tolerate nothing less than a thorough walk. So we walked. 

About three-quarters of the way through our walk, I *checked in* again. My pain was substantially less. I’m not asking for gone. I’m hoping for *less*. 

Two observations stood out for me: 
1. *Checking in* is good. *Checking in* regularly is better. 
2. I’m not sure who said it, but as a general principle, *motion is lotion*.

So, perhaps this second is a good time for you to check in? What's going on for you *right now*? Are you having any discomfort? On the other hand, *are you feeling good*? What do you notice in your surroundings? What's been good today? What's been challenging?
