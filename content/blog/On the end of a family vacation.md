On the end of a family vacation

It had been a while since we'd seen each other. Age has crept up on us. We have our differences now that the world is different. Still, there was goodness, laughter, and kindess. And, perhaps... The wonder that always occurs when family parts from one another??

*The time of anticipation  
Of preparation  
Of travel  
Of planning, savoring, recollecting  
Of the knowledge  
From the first night  
Until the last  
Where we look  
In the rear view mirror  
And take the turn out of the circle  
Onto the highway*    

*Be with this sadness.  
Stay here for a while.  
Avoid the phone.  
The book.  
Or whatever it is  
We do to salve hard feelings.  
Be present with them.  
They are our Teacher  
About What Matters.  
About What has given us strength.  
About Where we can return  
When things get hard.  
The comfort and sadness are twins.  
We can’t live without both.*    

*Every culture has a way of parting:  
Letters  
Stone markers  
Prayers  
Gifts*    

*These are all reminders of  
The leaving we do each day  
That which we take for granted  
The hug,  
The kiss,  
The putting away of what we used  
The cleaning up.*    

*In this gathering together, we were reminded  
Of who we were  
Of who we are  
Of how we’ve stayed the same  
Of how we’ve changed  
Of what we were together  
Of who we are together right now*    

*Sometimes, being present  
Right here, right now  
Evokes memories,  
Uncertainties,  
Hopes for things yet to come,  
And the bonds of connections  
That have gone before*    

*Together,  
In this book called Family  
We write our History,  
Past,  
And we have each dog-eared the corner of this page.  
A Bookmark.*    

*As much as any marker  
We could possibly leave  
This time together was invocationn  
And elegy  
For each other  
For all of us together    
For our pasts, presents, and futures.*     

*Whatever you face,    
Wherever you go,    
If you sat around this table  
Whoever and whatever you are  
Human or dog   
If you looked at old pictures   
Or used the old cup measure  
Or tasted recipes drawn from an ancient book   
or pencil-scribed postcard  
You are family  
You are held in our tenuous Bonds  
Bonds of past, present, and future  
This initiation or continuance  
And its stories are forever yours*    

*We impart on you a Sacred Wish  
May you live in safety  
In peace  
Held in gentle love  
May you, in whatever journeys  
Come your way,  
In THAT moment,  
Hold these moments   
As Sacred Reminders   
That You are Loved.   
Held tightly  
Irrevocably   
In the shared, passionate love,   
That has surrounded you here.   
You are loved.   
Return here when you doubt.*
