We recently purchased a robot vacuum cleaner. It's amazing. I understand there's a lot of math involved in it's mapping and processing. Cassie, the doggoe, gives it a wide berth. We've also had to make our own adaptations (keep cords off the floors). As much as Cassie sheds, this felt like a helpful purchase. 

I do have my doubts about all these technologies, though. They may reduce our labors in some ways, but they increase it in others. As well, they add other expenses. 

Finally, I worry they take us away from the essentially human work and pleasures. This morning I read about this [Jigsaw puzzle solver](https://www.hackster.io/news/give-piece-a-chance-e3b09f45b128). It can reduce the time it takes a human to solve a jigsaw puzzle by as much as 200%.

Barb loves her jigsaw puzzles. We have at least one completed [Harry Potter puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter) hanging on a wall here in the house (somewhere...). She loves her Harry Potter and [Lego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego) puzzles. The more pieces, the better! 

I like watching her progress and process. She paces herself. She is careful to avoid letting the pieces fall. When she hits a hard place, she stops and returns later. And, when it's done, she's exuberant. 

In my studies on depression, the process of healing from depression involves daily and long-term activities providing pleasure and accomplishment. In fact, this approach to depression reduction is called *behavioral activation*. It involves action, not frittering our time away in thought. Do things that give pleasure and accomplishment. 

Returning to *Hard Work*, technology promises to make our life easier. Is that always a good goal? 

A better question is this: does this technology really support my *well-being?*

We need to work with our hands, wash dishes, plant things, do math, and to show our work. We need to complete the puzzle without a computer. The human spirit craves *The Hard Work* of doing things.
