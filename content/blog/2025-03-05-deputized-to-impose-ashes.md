It's Ash Wednesday. I feel a little sad about that. Why? When I think of Ash Wednesday, here's the thing I remember most. 

I was a chaplain at Baylor Scott & White Heart and Vascular Hospital in Dallas. Even though I wasn't Catholic, each Ash Wednesday I was deputized to impose Ashes on the foreheads of anyone who wanted them. I received Ashes and then was *deputized* to impose them on others. I would visit every unit at the hospital to make sure people could get Ashes if they wanted them. There were always lots of questions:

* **Why does your head have a black mark on it?**  
  *To be deputized to impose Ashes, you have to receive Ashes and be repentant.*

* **What is the significance of imposing Ashes?**  
  *I'm not Catholic, but it has to do with realizing we are sinful and we need God. At least, that's my interpretation.*

* **Do you have to be Catholic?**  
  *No. See my forehead. I had it done and I'm not Catholic.*

* **Do I have to become Catholic?**  
  *No. See the above answer. In fact, you stay just the way you are.*

* **Do you have to be religious?**  
  *I'm not speaking for the Catholic (or any other church), but I could imagine everyone feels like a mess sometime in their lives. Right then is a perfect moment for your own Ash Wednesday. Even if you don't have Ashes. If you want to call on the Universe and say, I need help, then do that then. Don't be bound by any ideology or belief system where it doesn't fit you.*

People from all different traditions wanted me to give them Ashes. *Go ahead, hit me!*

Before coming to work at the hospital, Ash Wednesday wasn't part of my faith tradition. But, in a surprising turn, it became every year's most Sacred event. I got to touch the heads of countless patients, family members, and staff, offer the words, *"Repent and believe the Gospel,"* and then impose Ashes. This little encounter symbolized all that gives me hope about the human and divine. 

*I miss those days.* This is the second year where I haven't touched those foreheads. For all of you I did touch, who were on  my list each year, I still send you my love. The Ashes went one way. The Touch went both.
