This is a continuing riff on *gurus* and *specialness*. Today, I wanted to write about the *personal specialness* we sometimes attribute to ourselves. 

*What's so special about you that you can't be touched by that sort of grief*, said my Chaplain Supervisor? 

He referenced my verbatim report of the death of a newborn. Chaplains routinely write verbatim reports where they explore moments -- in many cases, the actual spoken words -- where they were challenged by difficult ministry events. The death of a newborn shook me to my core. In my *verbatim* I wondered how I could provide any *good* care to the family if I was caught up in my own grief (we had a son on the way at the time).

*We have a lot of chaplains available during the day shift. Can't you ask for help? Or, are you above that? Do you have some specialness that lifts you above the rest of us?*

Psychiatrist Irvin Yalom described our *belief in our specialness* as one of the most pernicious and prevalent human struggles. He was right. My Supervisor reminded me of both my faulty belief and the perfect course of action: *ask for help*. As long as we believe in our *specialness* we lose our ability to see other options. In our efforts to *save face* or preserve *our status* by not asking for help, we are driving *under the influence* of our *specialness*. 

We're all struggling. No one is above the fray. We all need help one time or another. We all *drop the ball*.
