We know you're dead when there's you're body quits trying. 

As a cardiovascular hospital chaplain, I was always (and never) surprised by the way the body would try to live. When big vessels were blocked, the heart muscle would grow new vessels to help make sure flow kept happening. 

The body is trying. 

We should keep trying. We're tempted to give up on ourselves. We're tempted to quit trying. 

Keep trying. This moment is not all there is nor all there will be.
