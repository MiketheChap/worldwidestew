Stuck on the tarmac and then the terminal at O'hare on September 11, 2001, my son and I tried to figure out what to do, where to go, and how we would respond. We knew precisely nothing about what was going on. Memory is a fuzzy thing. As I remember, somewhere along the way, someone decided the best idea was to turn off the televisions in the terminal. Likely to reduce panic. 

*Pro-Tip for the **geniuses who want to reduce panic**:* - don't turn off the one source of news if the *cat is already out of the bag*. 

Our ordeal began on the tarmac where my ten-year-old son and I were waiting to take off. About forty-five minutes in, the Captain came on and said, *Ladies and Gentlemen, we regret to tell you that there has been some kind of terrorist attack along the East Coast. We don't have any details. But, for safety's sake, we must return to the terminal.*

We got back to the terminal and then tried to figure out where we would go, where we'd stay, and how to be safe. Even crazy things entered the mind: *The terminal has a lot of glass walls. We've got to quickly get into a more secure area, prefereably downstairs.* 

I worry about our country today. On that day, the *better angels of our nature* was on full display. I remember a woman who saw my son and I huddling alone near the escalators. She didn't wait a beat. She asked if we had a place to stay. If we needed one, we could come with her. 

Fortunately, my wife had friends I'd never met, Nancy and John, who we were sure would be a place to stay. Indeed, they were. So, we didn't need to use this kind lady's home. Still, I'll be forrever grateful and indebted to her solace, if not her home. I wish I could thank her now. 

On that day, I found some strength even in the midst of confusion, fear, and doubt. I've written this poem as a reflection on *my experience* that day. I've also written it to remind myself that - if I could trust myself then - I can be assured of the wisdom I need for today. You have also had similar experiences. The one's where you survived because you listened to your internal compass. This is a psalm to celebrate our internal compass. 

#### Trusting Yourself 
There was that moment  
That instant when you were called to a strength  
To exercise a wisdom for which you felt unprepared  
Unjustified to exercise  
And for which there was no personal plan  
No guideline  
No idea.  

It just was.  

You were called to make choices  
on the fly.  
To protect self  
and loved ones.  
Unsure the extent, location, or proximity  
of what you feared.  

You had to draw only  
on your best instinct  
You had to think your most intuitive thoughts  
Not running, exactly,  
But moving with caution, 
thought,  
and deliberation.  

Looking for those with whom you could huddle  
And those from whom you must hide.  

You survived because you listened.  
Because you listened to your inner caution  
But not too much. You must still go on.  
You survived because you knew to stop and take stock  
But not too long. Keep moving until known safe.  
You survived because you looked for help  
And weighed whom you could trust.  
You survived because you considered what might come,  
and from where,  
but avoided attachment to one place.  
You survived because you looked for likely safety  
In spite of risks.  

Today, distant from that place and time.  
Those resources aren't far away.  
You can - and would - do it all again  
If you needed to.  
Those resources sprung up from within you  
From your experiences,  
From your wisdom,  
From your trust (and distrust),  
From uncertainty (and internal assurance).  
For some moment today,  
Sit back and try to trust the Inner You  
The You with doubts and fears,  
Hopes and dreams.  
The You who's responsive, inner River,  
Will ebb and crest,  
When you listen and need it most.
