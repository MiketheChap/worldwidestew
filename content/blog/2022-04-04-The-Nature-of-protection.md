One cool weekend evening about a month ago, my wife and I were sitting on the back porch watching the day *coast to a halt*. It was a pretty evening with a butterfly - it looked like a monarch butterfly - flitting about. It seemed too early in the year for monarchs to be passing through. Naturally, I had to look it up. 

As expected, the monarch is often confused (by us amateurs) with another butterfly that's often seen in the spring in North Texas: the *Viceroy butterfly*.

Here's the crazy thing. The Monarch butterfly and the Viceroy possess similar coloration. Those colors may be beautiful to humans, but the colorations themselves are a *warning* to many other creatures. Over eons, many defenseless creatures have evolved their colors after other creatures. In the case of the Monarch and the Viceroy,  case, the monarch and the viceroy - both whose taste is awful - have come to share similar coloration over time as a shared nature warning: *eat us at your peril*. This is one of several kinds of mimicry designed for protection. Two of those mimicries are called [Mullerian mimicry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_mimicry) and [Batesian Mimicry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batesian_mimicry). 

Even more amazing? Many species have adopted these shared colorations for warning purposes: 

*Müllerian mimicry was first identified in tropical [butterflies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly) that shared colourful wing patterns, but it is found in many groups of insects such as [bumblebees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumblebee), and other animals including [poison frogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranitomeya) and [coral snakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_snake). The mimicry need not be visual; for example, many snakes share [auditory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)) warning signals. Similarly, the defences involved are not limited to toxicity; anything that tends to deter predators, such as foul taste, sharp spines, or defensive behaviour can make a species unprofitable enough to predators to allow Müllerian mimicry to develop.*

Coral snakes? Yes, *coral snakes*. Think about their coloration: *red to yellow, kill a fellow; red to black, venom lack*. This is an example of ring colorations.
