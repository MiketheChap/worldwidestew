Asking *Why am I here?* is probably wasting time. It's like a termite trying to eat a sequoia. It's too big and carries little action. 

You're probably better off asking two other questions:
- What things matter to me?
- What things matter to the people I care about?

There's a host of other questions you can (and should) ask. But these are awesome places to start or reset. Begin with either one, then tackle the other one.
