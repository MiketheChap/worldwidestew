Just sitting there is not meditating. 

I know. I've excused my sitting there countless times so I could cross off that day's meditation. It's fascinating our penchant for checking off items on our lists. In reality, I could have been excused truly wanting to be with what was real and then what happened, happened. 

On the other hand.

Sitting there, standing there, or even lying down there with *the intention* of meditating - even if you *do it poorly or get distracted or fall asleep or any of a million other things* - is still in the meditation zone. Why? Because I showed up with intention. 

*Intention* turns the wheel that, ever so slowly and patiently, frees the mind to occupy itself with what truly matters.
