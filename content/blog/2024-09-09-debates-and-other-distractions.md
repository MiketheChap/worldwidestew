I can hear the question tomrrow. Did you watch the Debate? 

In my opinion, perhaps unlike other historical periods, debates make no sense. Zero. No one watches a debate to learn something. They watch because we are card-carrying, dues-paying, addicted members of what Guy Debord called the *Society of Spectacle* (thanks for educating me on this [Stephen West](https://www.philosophizethis.org/podcast/episode-171-guy-debord?rq=spectacle)). 

I want to see the poll asking people if they watched the debates prepared to learn something they didn't know or to modify their beliefs or political preferences. As someone once said, *Our minds are like concrete: permanently set and all mixed up.*

In these times of widespread cynicism and polarization, we should withdraw from *politics as entertainments*, especially those from which we aren't prepared to learn and change. Decidedly, very few people had any such intention last night.
