"I'm tired of fighting the same old battles," we might say. 

So, which battles would you prefer to fight? No battles? Only the hardest ones where you stand to lose the most? Or only the ones of your own choosing? If you chose the last option - the battles of your own choosing - are they really battles then? 

Humans need our *battles*. Battles engage parts of the nervous system that need engagement. If we only get the battles we want, we won't get all the ones we need to thrive, maintain our interests, or to keep our edge.

Skirmishes can be a good thing. 

It may be you are ready to level up. That's a different discussion. Is that where you're at? If so, perhaps it's time to take a different sort of *action*. The key word in that last sentence is *action*. If that is where you want to go, figure out:
* What *actions* you need to take to *up your game* (develop your skills to be prepared when you get your chance)
* The areas where you are weak and begin brushing up. If necessary, find a place in your current situation where you can identify ways to practice. For example, are you easily distracted; do you have difficulties focusing in on what others want? These are learned and practiced skills. 
* Who's attention you need to capture to get a chance to demonstrate your skills and plan a way to engage them. 
* How to cultivate being fully present in this game right now versus another one you wish you were in. Who are the players in this game? How might you engage them more completely versus just treating them as game-pieces? Do you have any idea what would make the *game* better for all of you?

P.S. Self-talk is vital. Looking back on this post, I'm reminded that I needed this self-talk. So, perhaps this was more for me, than for you. Perhaps.
