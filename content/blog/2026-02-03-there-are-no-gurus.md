[Guru](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/guru) (*noun*)
1: a personal religious teacher and spiritual guide in Hinduis
2a: a teacher and especially intellectual guide in matters of fundamental concern
has been a guru to many young writers
b: one who is an acknowledged leader or chief proponent

c: a person with knowledge or expertise : expert
*a computer guru*

There are people, with good reason, whom we admire. They seem to know how to navigate difficult circumstances or challenges. They intuitively possess life wisdom. Or, they have special knowledge. 

Though it can be natural to elevate gifted people, it becomes a problem when we elevate their status too much. No one is untouchable by life's circumstances. No one, no matter how skilled or gifted, is above the human mess. We know this is the case! Yet, we persist in our attribution of guru status and subsequent disappointment when they struggle or fail. It's axiomatic: *Humans are human*. We make mistakes (often). We have accidents. We drop things. We get hit broadside. We fumble and fall. 

I'll mention this again tomorrow, but psychiatrist Irvin Yalom described our *belief in our specialness* as one of the most pernicious and prevalent human struggles. He was right. It troubles me when I read someone being described in elevated or special terms. The term *Thought Leader* is an example. What qualifies someone as being a *Thought Leader*? Do they look more consternated when they think? These kinds of terms are *marketing speak*. 

*What's so special about you that you can't be touched by that sort of grief*, said my Chaplain Supervisor? 

He referenced my verbatim report of the death of a newborn. Chaplains routinely write verbatim reports where they explore moments -- in many cases, the actual spoken words -- where they were challenged by difficult ministry events. The death of a newborn shook me to my core. In my *verbatim* I wondered how I could provide any *good* care to the family if I was caught up in my own grief (we had a son on the way at the time).

*We have a lot of chaplains available during the day shift. Can't you ask for help? Or, are you above that? Do you have some specialness that lifts you above the rest of us?*

We're all struggling. No one is above the fray. We all need help one time or another. We all *drop the ball*. 

Who do you admire? Do they have *the freedom to be human*, to fail, to be less than perfect? Don't they deserve that? This isn't about accountability or legal matters. It's about the experience of being human.
