*Alien Intelligences* surround us. Not space aliens (though I'm not ruling them out). Nor about immigrants. I'm talking about *other ways of knowing*. We ignore *Alien Intelligences* at our peril.

My dog, Cassie, and I are out walking early in the morning. It's still dark. She stops and looks down the street. She sees something. At first, I try to *get her back into walking mode*. But, she insists. There's something there. She's right. A large unleashed dog is coming toward us. We change directions and successfully avoid the dog. 

Cassie is an Alien Intelligence. She *sees* the world with distinctly different skills. Even with a little problem with her right eye, she can still see changes at a distance I can't. She also smells the world with much greater detail than I could imagine. Sometimes, I wish I had a *dog translator*. I swear she tells me, *Hey, Dad! Come on down here. Take a whiff of that smell! You don't know what you're missing!*

Alien Intelligences refers to the web of different ways that all creatures know their world. Every species understands what it sees and experiences in a distinctly different way. This kaleidoscope of senses, thinking processes, behavioral history, and residual adaptations is so individualized that it's even more unique than a fingerprint. 

Sometimes, I imagine I can see a wolf who's betrayed an individual streak. She lives in a Siberian forest. Under the cover of darkness while hunting one might, she comes on a pile of animal remains, bones mostly. Perhaps they have the smell of smoke. The wolf spies a creature she's only seen in passing. It is larger, and walks upright. It considers attacking but views the creature with wariness and caution. She decides to stalk the creature, to investigate it. The Up-Walker is an Alien Intelligence. 

Over the coming weeks and months, she continues to track the Up-Walker. She is grateful for the bones and viscera that the Up-Walker leaves. For it's part, as the Up-Walker looks into the nighttime forest - with it's own Alien Intelligence - it knows it's not alone. He can see shadows lurking in the dark, circling around the fire and the cave where he hides. He also sees that the scrps he's left after a kill are gone the next morning. 

On one particularly cold night, he sees the shadows drawing closer. He thinks about how hard and cold life is when trying to forage and hunt for food. He decides to leave a few extra scraps at the edge of his camp. 

In time, this dance between the Up-Walker and the wolf becomes a habit. Rather than the wolf grabbing and fleeing with the bones and viscera, she eats them on the spot. She's starving. She can't wait. 

With some satisfaction, the Up-Walker sees her coming incresingly close these days. In time, she comes closer and closer to the camp. Up-Walker notices that she has grown larger. He knows what this means. He sees his world as big. He is part of a much larger Universe. Every creature is part of that Universe. So, his knowing causes him to feel some kinship with her. He leaves larger amounts of meat. And, not just scraps. He hopes she will survive the hardships of the winters as well as the needs of her pups. 

At the begnning of the post, I showed a picture of a horse. 

This is why our encounters with other Alien Intelligences are so critical to our own well-being.
