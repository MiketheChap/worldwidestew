I have a group of dear friends, most of whom live in California. I meet with them by Zoom most weeks or as often as I can. Each person in the group makes my life better every time I see them. Their smiles radiate.

The group leader brings an immediate sense of calm to all. She models vulnerability, humanity, and divinity. She has taught me about meditation and life personally and formally, though I've never met her in person. I will do that sometime! 

My thoughts are turning to my friends
Who are near the burning fires. 
I feel sad for the Earth
On whom we have released our greed, 
Avarice,
And unbridled desire for control. 

My thoughts turn to animals,
Critters, 
Trees, 
And woodlands caught in the conflagration 
To which we bear some responsibility.

Things happen. 
This is true. 
We can, however, 
Bring healing to the lands 
On which we live.
We can take less from them,
And give more. 

The ancient traditions 
Honored the lands, the animals, the air.
They understood that space had to be made
For living, healing, rebuilding. 

It is to this
That we must bend our hearts and minds.

In this time, though,
Our prayers are with thouse who suffer. 

Whatever you believe in, bring wishes of kindness
To all those who suffer, 
For them to be safe and able to live in peace.
