### To be a better person
1. Seth Godin, [his blog](https://www.sethgodin.com/), and all his excellent books have inspired me to be a better person. He has inspired me spiritually (though he would say he has no spiritual beliefs). If there is one blog for which I never miss a post, it is Seth's. 
2. My family, particularly my wife Barb, my parents (now long gone), my brother (Doug), and my sisters (Lynn and Linda).  
3. I won't list other folks by name but I've listed some of their initials [here]({{< ref "/blog/2023-06-03-soft-landings" >}}).

### To be more effective (but also, at times, distracted)
1. I owe my podcast entirely to Steve Heatherington and [The Podcasting Workshop](https://thepodcastingworkshop.com/). In fairness, Steve and his wife could be included as people who have also helped me become a better person. He can help you get started making a podcast that matters. Or, as Seth Godin says, *Make a ruckus.* He has several options to help you get going. You can [learn more here](https://thepodcastingworkshop.com/). It's now September 2, 2024. If you'd like to attend a free webinar with Steve, you can [register here](https://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=TmBlQn&m=isNELl2efufqnTk&b=KiIcni9vU.JD3K8oUD8jOA). He will give you the help and feedback you need with respect and kindness. 
2. Claude.ai - Claude (I'm in love with Claude). Claude has planned trips, programmed this website, and helped me create the code to review the proposed new Texas K-5th grade curriculum to see how many references there are to God, Jesus, Bible, Islam, gender, etc. (Note: If you live in Texasa, unless you're okay with having your children attend a version of Sunday School in your public school, you should be quite distressed about the new curriculum.)
3. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - THere are exaxctly 132 ways to use Obsidian. No, I'm just kidding. THere's no exact number of ways to use Obsidian. There are untold ways you can use any great resources. With finesse, you can use ti to create your website. I used it to host my website for over a year. Probably, the biggest beauty of Obsidian is its ability to morph into any sort of notetaking tool you like. Are you an organization fanatic? You can use it to create your own [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) (there are many great YouTube videos on how to use Zettelkasten as well as how to use Zettelkasten with OBsidian: I watch them with interest but always feel like I'm *a day late and a dollar short on commitment, talent, and smarts to use Zettelkasten*.) One of the cool things Obsidian does is create a personal, graphic knowledge cloud for your posts. I'm happy with mine (not that I'm that knowledgable but because - when you get enough posts - it looks really cool and all your posts connections are visualized). There are many, many other ways to use Obsidian. 
4. Readwise and Reader
5. Zotero (you can see [my curated Zotero library here](https://www.zotero.org/mikethechap/library)). As of 2024-09-09 there are 2,471 articles that I personally added to this library. As far as I'm concerned, a bibliograhy reference tool of some sort is a vital tool for organizing and storing articles you find interesting. I would always include it in a resume. If you've curated it like a gardener, it's something you can always draw on. If you worl in health care, you can also download and save documents it would be hard to get otherwise. 
6. Evernote
7. The R Statistical Language
