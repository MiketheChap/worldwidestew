### To be a better person
1. Seth Godin, [his blog](https://www.sethgodin.com/), and all his excellent books have inspired me to be a better person. He has inspired me spiritually (though he would say he has no spiritual beliefs). If there is one blog for which I never miss a post, it is Seth's.

1. I owe my podcast entirely to Steve Heatherington and [The Podcasting Workshop](https://thepodcastingworkshop.com/). In fairness, Steve and his wife could be included as people who have also helped me become a better person. He can help you get started making a podcast that matters. Or, as Seth Godin says, *Make a ruckus.* He has several options to help you get going. You can [learn more here](https://thepodcastingworkshop.com/). It's now September 2, 2024. If you'd like to attend a free webinar with Steve, you can [register here](https://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=TmBlQn&m=isNELl2efufqnTk&b=KiIcni9vU.JD3K8oUD8jOA). He will give you the help and feedback you need with respect and kindness.
