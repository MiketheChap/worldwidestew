##### About WorldWide Stew
Worldwide Stew is the continuing vision of Mike Davis' future. He is a Board Certified Chaplain with the Spiritual Care Association (among other certifications). 

Who is Mike? Chaplain specializing in cardiovascular and end-of-life care. I also have experience in clinical research study design, preparation, data gathering, and reporting. I’m also a Certified Workplace Mindfulness Facilitator (CWMF) through Mindful Leader. I’ve been leading mindfulness sessions for two years priori to my retirement in December 2023. I’ve started doing mindfulness sessions again via Zoom with interested individuals in my new life chapter ([learn more here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XJMAs5ieSmFgZZuNpkF1bLkwrdDSpboPMKREmXJ_pLo/edit), [sign up here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LQP2uy1-w8zzHE5_5QTA6kAWFSxcvK2LzB0zxaurpOk/viewform?edit_requested=true)). I’m currently working on a Positive Psychology Certification from U Penn. 

Mostly, I’m interested in helping relieve suffering and marshaling the human spirit and consciousness to help with that. I’m a lifelong learner. Unlike many of my learning efforts in the past, I’m no longer trying so hard to learn what the Gatekeepers tell me to: I’m learning what I want to learn. If I can help you, please let me know. 

My effort here will be brevity (admittedly quite an exercise for the author), consideration, reflection, and, perhaps, greater insight through the passing of time: *How does the stew actually taste?*  You and I are the judges of success. I'm ninety-nine percent certain I will miss the mark for both of us. Part of my failures will be related to  expression of unformed (or worse, idiotic) ideas, biases, poor research, and lack of knowledge (think [the Dunning-Kruger Effect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780123855220000056?via%3Dihub)). 

I will revisit, edit, amend, and change my posts and my life. Most thoughts here aren’t fully formed and certainly not ready for publication (I probably changed my mind shortly after putting it online!). They are my effort to keep creating and to *practice* writing. 
  
I'll  write about whatever suits me and - hopefully, perhaps - you: inspiration, a modicum of politics, religion (more likely spirituality), cooking, events in general, some science, and some management crap. 

I've tried to organize the site into big menu categories. These are important:
1. Blog - Here, I focus on inspiration, life qualities, positive psychology, and personal growth. I'll generally avoid politics here, though not always. 
2. About - [Resources](https://worldwidestew.com/about/my-resources/) This is stuff about me. If you hate home movies, you probably won't like this much, either. Still, there's the smallest of chances there will be something here to interest you.
    a. [Resources](https://worldwidestew.com/about/my-resources/) 
3. Events - I'm leading meditation sessions and will be teaching classes.
4. Media - things I've recorded you might be interested in. Some might be meaningful, some silly, some meditation sessions I've recorded and links to others.
5. Deep Dive - In this area I share recent research psychology articles I've read, political and ethics perspectives, opinions, and even recipes. 
  
We first posted on our Blogger account on September 26, 2008. I didn't put much there. The same may happen here. However, it seems like my goal of a daily writing practice is closer. 

You can see some of my research interests in my [curated Zotero academic library](https://www.zotero.org/mikethechap/library). The link has references to categorized and reviewed articles (>2,625). 

Who is Mike as a person?
Honestly, I suspect I'm a bit (or a lot) curmudgeonly. A chaplain student I worked with said he was initially put off by my - he said it kindlier - grumpiness (as I remember). He said he was really grateful for my interactions with him. I don't think many people are as honest as he was. I can recall my exact place in the hallway when he told me this. I guess I wish that I didn't come across that way. Anyway, if we happen to meet, please be patient. I assure you I only want the best. 

Mike couldn't recognize himself if he saw himself on the street. There's a gognitive disorder called [prosopagnosia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopagnosia) or *face blindness*. Apparently, it's distressing to some people. I've never been formally diagnosed with this condition. Apparently, about 2.5% of the population has some version of it. I mostly can remember other people's faces. But, if I passed myself on the street, I wouldn't know it was me. I know this because I met a nearly complete doppleganger once in my work as a chaplain. When I walked into a patient's room, they were utterly freaked out. 

>*It seems like you've seen a ghost. Did I do or say something wrong?*

>The husband pulled out a picture of their grandson. *Take a look at this*. 

I looked. 

>*Yes?*

>*He is a spitting image of you."

Nurses came in and looed at me, then at the picture. We looked nearly identical, just different in ages. 

Anyway, that's my *face blindness* story and I'm sticking with it.
