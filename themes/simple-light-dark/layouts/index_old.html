  <h4>A little about Worldwide Stew</h4>
    <p>Cook it long and slow. Allow all the flavors to meld. Serve only when it’s ready. That’s the goal here. </p>
    <p>Some restaurants slam meals together using a few cheap spices bought in bulk long-past their expiration date; pre-mixed sauces; and pre-cooked items. There's lots of sodium to give the illusion of flavor. In short, most restaurants create processed foods. </p>
	<p>Who is Mike? Chaplain specializing in cardiovascular and end-of-life care. I also have experience in clinical research study design, preparation, data gathering (REDCAP), and reporting. I’m also a <a href="https://www.credential.net/f537eded-cc25-4f5a-ae40-9941fbb344f6">Certified Workplace Mindfulness Facilitator (CWMF) through Mindful Leader</a>. I’ve been leading mindfulness sessions for two years before my retirement in December 2023. Since then, I’ve started doing mindfulness sessions again via Zoom. If you're interested, there's information <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XJMAs5ieSmFgZZuNpkF1bLkwrdDSpboPMKREmXJ_pLo/edit">here</a>.

	<p>My effort here will be brevity (admittedly quite an exercise for the author), consideration, reflection, and, perhaps, greater insight through the passing of time: <i>How does the stew actually taste?</i>  You and I are the judges of success. I'm ninety-nine percent certain I will miss the mark for both of us. Some of my failures will be related to writing unformed (or worse, idiotic) ideas, biases, poor research, and lack of knowledge (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780123855220000056?via%3Dihub">think of the Dunning-Kruger Effect</a>).
	<p>Mostly, I’m interested in the relief of suffering and marshaling the human spirit and consciousness to help with that. I’m a lifelong learner. Unlike many of my learning efforts in the past, I’m no longer trying so hard to learn what <i>the Gatekeepers</i> tell me to: <i>I’m learning what is most important to me - and I hope- to you.</i></p>
	<p>I will revisit, edit, amend, and change my posts and my life. Most thoughts here aren’t fully formed and certainly not ready for publication (I probably changed my mind shortly after putting it online!). They are my effort to keep creating and to <i>practice</i> writing. 
	<p>I'll  write about whatever suits me and - hopefully, perhaps - you: a modicum of politics, religion (more likely spirituality), cooking, events in general, some science, and some management crap.</p>
	<p>We first posted on our Blogger account on September 26, 2008. I didn't put much there. The same may happen here. However, it seems like my goal of a daily writing practice is closer.</p>
	<p>In 2024 I started working on a new website. I was using Obsidian to publish my website. I wasn't happy with it because I couldn't show my latest posts first. I've been learning about other tools to publish. I've settled on the Hugo JAMstack website tool. However, I also have to learn its nuances. I'm getting close.</p>
